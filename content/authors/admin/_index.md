Hello there!

I am an AI Research Assistant at [Qatar University](https://www.qu.edu.qa/sites/), actively contributing to multiple Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)-funded projects. My current research focus centers on the analysis of privacy and security in AI models. In previous projects, I explored the detection of hypoglycemic events from medical IoT devices using AI. Also in a previous project I worked in forecasted Covid-19 spread in Qatar and analysing the effect of various lockdown measures on the virus spread.

I earned my master's degree in cybersecurity from [Hamad Bin Khalifa University](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en) (HBKU), supervised by [Prof. Roberto di Pietro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Io9QeG0AAAAJ). My thesis involved utilizing AI models to design a continuous authentication scheme using PPG signals. Furthermore, my bachelor's degree from Qatar University included a senior project supervised by Dr. [Abdulkarim Erradi](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/erradi/), focusing on leveraging crowd sourcing to enhance Qatar's transportation during the 2022 World Cup.

If you are interested in more information, you can check out my C.V. Or we can set up a meeting to have more in depth discussion.
