abstract: Extracting electric vehicle (EV) charging loads is an important aspect that
  enables smart grid operators to make informed and intelligent decisions about conserving
  power and promoting the reliability of the electrical grid. This paper presents
  an unsupervised algorithm to extract the EV charging loads (EVCLs) nonintrusively
  from the smart meter data. The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart
  meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type
  of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real
  aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising
  solution to extract EVCLs and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference
  of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as EVs. Furthermore, the extraction
  of such load behaviors can be aggregated and open further smart grid analyses and
  studies.
