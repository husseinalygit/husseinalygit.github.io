abstract: Decarbonization of the transport sector is a major challenge in the transition
  towards net-zero emissions. Even though the penetration of electric vehicles (EV)
  in the passenger vehicle fleet is increasing, the energy mix is not yet dominated
  by renewables. This leads to the utilization of fossil-based power generation for
  EV charging, especially during peak hours. In this work, we introduce a residential
  smart EV charging framework that prioritizes solar photovoltaic (PV) power self-consumption
  to accelerate the transition to a carbon neutral passenger vehicle fleet. Our approach
  employs N-Step Deep Reinforcement Learning to charge the EV with clean energy from
  a PV, without neglecting other major factors that influence end usersâ€™ behavior,
  such as electricity cost or EV charging tendencies. Historical smart-meter data
  from the Pecan Street dataset on total consumption, EV demand and solar generation
  has been utilized as input features to train the Deep RL method so that it decides
  on a real-time basis whether to charge or not the EV, without the need for foresight
  of future observations. Experimental results on six residential houses validate
  that, compared to uncontrolled EV charging, the proposed method can increase the
  average self-consumption of solar energy for EV charging by 19.66%, as well as reduce
  network stress by 7% and electricity bill by 10.3%.
