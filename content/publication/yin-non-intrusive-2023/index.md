abstract: With the widespread use of electric vehicles (EVs), the charging behavior
  of these resources has brought a large amount of load growth to the grid, leading
  to a series of problems such as increased peak valley load difference and line flow
  violation. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a key technology that can be
  employed to monitor the multi-source load data information in the power grid and
  support the high-proportion access of electric vehicles. However, traditional NILM
  approaches are designed to identify the operation of household appliances and cannot
  be applied at the substation level directly due to frequent and intricate switching
  events of electrical equipment at this stage. In this paper, a NILM algorithm that
  can be applied for the monitoring of the charging behavior of electric vehicles
  at the substation level is proposed to support the high-proportion injection of
  distributed energy resources. The proposed approach employs a deep learning framework
  and a multi-kernel convolutional neural network (multi-kernel CNN) framework is
  used. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the self-organized datasets
  based on Pecan Street data and results showed that the obtained f1 score is over
  90% for both the training sets and testing sets.
