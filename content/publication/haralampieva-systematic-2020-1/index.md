abstract: 'This work provides a comprehensive review of existing frameworks based
  on secure computing techniques in the context of private image classification. The
  in-depth analysis of these approaches is followed by careful examination of their
  performance costs, in particular runtime and communication overhead. To further
  illustrate the practical considerations when using different privacy-preserving
  technologies, experiments were conducted using four state-of-the-art libraries implementing
  secure computing at the heart of the data science stack: PySyft and CrypTen supporting
  private inference via Secure Multi-Party Computation, TF-Trusted utilising Trusted
  Execution Environments and HE-Transformer relying on Homomorphic encryption. Our
  work aims to evaluate the suitability of these frameworks from a usability, runtime
  requirements and accuracy point of view. In order to better understand the gap between
  state-of-the-art protocols and what is currently available in practice for a data
  scientist, we designed three neural network architecture to obtain secure predictions
  via each of the four aforementioned frameworks. Two networks were evaluated on the
  MNIST dataset and one on the Malaria Cell image dataset. We observed satisfying
  performances for TF-Trusted and CrypTen and noted that all frameworks perfectly
  preserved the accuracy of the corresponding plaintext model.'
