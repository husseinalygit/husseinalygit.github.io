abstract: Smart meters have been widely installed to monitor residential electricity
  usage worldwide. This brings a serious privacy challenge for the customers, because
  the meter readings can possibly expose their activities in the house. To address
  this privacy issue, battery-based privacy preserving schemes have already been studied
  for several years. In these schemes, a rechargeable battery can both prevent the
  meter readings from leaking the customer's energy consumption and play a role of
  saving the cost. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing schemes
  can achieve differential privacy and cost saving simultaneously. In this paper,
  we first propose a battery-based differential privacy-preserving (BDP) scheme. We
  further present two cost-friendly differential privacy-preserving (CDP) schemes
  by extending BDP scheme. Simulation analyses show that the privacy loss of both
  CDP schemes are smaller than the existing works. Meanwhile, both CDP schemes stably
  save the cost under multiple pricing policies.
