abstract: In this paper, we proposed 3-level authentication technique to prevent internal
  information leakage in network system. When system authenticates users, it requires
  user's ID&P/W firstly. Then, it requires a secondary authentication component to
  check whether he/she is legitimate user. By doing so, it can implement a more robust
  authentication system. The secondary authentication components are usually a security
  card, an encryption key and bio-information such as iris, face, fingerprint etc.
  But there is a problem related to ID&P/W exposure and bio-information copy. Especially,
  nobody knows can check whether ID&P/W are exposed, whether bioinformation is copied.
  So, we propose another authentication way using biometric signals. A biometric signal
  is essentially a pattern recognition factor that operates by acquiring biometric
  signals from an individual, extracting a feature set from the acquired signal pattern,
  and comparing this feature set against the template set in the database. We decided
  to use skin conductivity in the biometric signals as 3rd authentication element.
  The skin conductivity is used as an indication of psychological or physiological
  arousal. So, there is no risk because it never exposes or copies.
