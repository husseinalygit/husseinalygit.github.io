abstract: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) have now become ubiquitous. Due to its
  high-power consumption, the utility industry has strong motivation to provide this
  extra demand on off peak hours. It is anticipated that the potential stresses on
  power delivery systems can be mitigated through asset management, system design
  practices, controlled charging of PEVs, or some combination of the three. Due to
  high variability in customersâ€™ EV choices, car types, charging patterns, charging
  preferences, and participation in utility-centric TOU (time of usage) charging options,
  utility will not be able to manage this risk in an ex post fashion. In many cases,
  it is likely the utility will not be notified or aware of an electric vehicle (EV)
  addition. Such inefficiency calls for big data-centric approach that can not only
  detect households with PEVs, but can also provide some customized PEV charging incentives
  to managing imbalance in the grid system. Present paper developed a data-driven
  approach detecting households charging PEVs. The analysis performed here is based
  on high frequency advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data obtained from a large-scale
  utility company in Midwest. The data-driven models developed here achieved an accuracy
  of 80% or more in successfully detecting households with PEVs.
