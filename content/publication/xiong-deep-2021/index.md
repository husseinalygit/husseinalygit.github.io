abstract: Electromyography (EMG) has already been broadly used in human-machine interaction
  (HMI) applications. Determining how to decode the information inside EMG signals
  robustly and accurately is a key problem for which we urgently need a solution.
  Recently, many EMG pattern recognition tasks have been addressed using deep learning
  methods. In this paper, we analyze recent papers and present a literature review
  describing the role that deep learning plays in EMG-based HMI. An overview of typical
  network structures and processing schemes will be provided. Recent progress in typical
  tasks such as movement classification, joint angle prediction, and force/torque
  estimation will be introduced. New issues, including multimodal sensing, inter-subject/inter-session,
  and robustness toward disturbances will be discussed. We attempt to provide a comprehensive
  analysis of current research by discussing the advantages, challenges, and opportunities
  brought by deep learning. We hope that deep learning can aid in eliminating factors
  that hinder the development of EMG-based HMI systems. Furthermore, possible future
  directions will be presented to pave the way for future research.
