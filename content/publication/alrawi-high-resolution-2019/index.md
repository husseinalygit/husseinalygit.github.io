abstract: 'Even though Qatar’s per capita electricity consumption is one of the highest
  in the world, little is currently known about behind-the-meter power consumption.
  The residential sector is the largest consumer of electricity, accounting for approximately
  59% of the overall consumption of electricity. As energy subsidies lead to budget
  deficits and overconsumption of carbon resources, there is a pressing need to examine
  the residential load profile to better understand consumption patterns and uncover
  potential solutions for more efficient usage. Residential load profiles are typically
  influenced by seasonal and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, household load profiles
  can be used to examine the viability of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this
  study, a total of 10 houses in Qatar were chosen, and their power demand was monitored
  for over a year using smart energy monitors. This empirical research was conducted
  to achieve the following goals: (1) creation of the first high-resolution residential
  load profiles in Qatar and in the Gulf region; (2) analyses of the acquired load
  profiles and the determining factors that affect energy consumption; and (3) calculation
  of self-consumption values, analysis of the viability of household rooftop PV systems,
  and discussing potential use-cases for energy storage systems. Investigation of
  this topic is particularly important for Qatar as the country is adopting a sizable
  portion of PV systems (5% by 2021) and promotes sustainable energy options as a
  part of a national development strategy. Results show that there are significant
  differences between per-household and per-capita consumption due to factors such
  as electricity subsidies, household income and size, and air-conditioner type. Moreover,
  due to high electricity consumption, distributed energy storage units for bill management
  applications have limited applicability with current pricing tariffs. To the best
  of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Qatar and in the Gulf
  region where a growing amount of interest is given to measure and improve building
  energy performance.'
