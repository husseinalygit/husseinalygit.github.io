abstract: 'Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the
  generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden
  node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed.
  However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be
  effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of
  hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical
  learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture
  is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed
  by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized
  hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer
  encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder
  is developed via â„“1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful
  feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of
  ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected
  before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster
  learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL),
  the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once
  the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without
  fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive
  experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed
  algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art
  hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision
  further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.'
