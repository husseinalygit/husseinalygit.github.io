abstract: Diabetes is one of the prominent diseases around the world. Presently, invasive
  techniques need a finger prick blood sample . A repetitively painful procedure that
  produces the chance of infection. To resolve this issue, non-invasive measurement
  approach is proposed. In this paper, an efficient NIR wave based optical detection
  system is proposed with optimized post-processing regression model. After real-time
  data analysis, it has been found that the coefficient of determination ($$Rtextasciicircum2$$R2)
  is improved with the value of 0.9084 using proposed regression model. Mean absolute
  derivative is also increased with 3.87 mg/dl corresponding to predicted blood glucose
  concentration. Mean absolute relative difference has exceeded to 3.25%, and average
  error is improved with 3.77% using proposed regression model. Average accuaracy
  has been analyzed 94–95% for predicted blood glucose concentration.
