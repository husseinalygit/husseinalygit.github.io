 abstract = {Diabetes is one of the prominent diseases around the world. Presently, invasive techniques need a finger prick blood sample . A repetitively painful procedure that produces the chance of infection. To resolve this issue, non-invasive measurement approach is proposed. In this paper, an efficient NIR wave based optical detection system is proposed with optimized post-processing regression model. After real-time data analysis, it has been found that the coefficient of determination (\$\$R\textasciicircum\2\\$\$R2) is improved with the value of 0.9084 using proposed regression model. Mean absolute derivative is also increased with 3.87 mg/dl corresponding to predicted blood glucose concentration. Mean absolute relative difference has exceeded to 3.25%, and average error is improved with 3.77% using proposed regression model. Average accuaracy has been analyzed 94–95% for predicted blood glucose concentration.},
