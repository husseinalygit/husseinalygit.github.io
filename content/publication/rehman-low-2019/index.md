abstract: Energy monitoring is inevitable towards achieving energy efficiency and
  conservation. Load disaggregation is one of the techniques towards effective energy
  monitoring. In the said domain, Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM)
  is an attractive method where aggregated load data are acquired from a single metering
  point and segregated appliance level load is estimated using effective software
  techniques. This paper presents a low complexity event-based NIALM technique based
  on supervised machine learning. In this paper, the emphasis is on the disaggregation
  of Air Conditioning (AC) unit and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging loads due to their
  high significance for the overall power grid stability improvement. A comprehensive
  digital simulation has been carried out to validate the performance of the proposed
  approach and intended appliances are aptly classified having an outcome of 97% for
  same Data ID and 95% for different Data ID in terms of precision, recall, and f-score
  performance metrics.
