abstract: While the development of electric vehicles brings positive effects to the
  environment, it also brings fire hazards to the community with repeated fatal fire
  accidents reported every year. Since the battery charging can be anywhere with the
  customers, it is of significance to have a technical means to detect and alert the
  customers. In this paper, we propose an electric vehicle charging load (EVCL) disaggregation
  method based on non-intrusive load monitoring technology. First, a non-intrusive
  EVCL disaggregation method based on independent component analysis with reference
  method to extract the charging periods is proposed. Then, algorithms for estimating
  both amplitude and time of EVCL based on signal reconstruction are applied. Finally,
  a validation on a publicly available real-world dataset published by Pecan Street
  is carried out and evaluated with two performance metrics of F1$_textrmscore$ and
  RMSE. The results show that the proposed method succeeds in EVCL extraction.
