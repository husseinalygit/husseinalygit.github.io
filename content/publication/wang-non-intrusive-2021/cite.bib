 abstract = {While the development of electric vehicles brings positive effects to the environment, it also brings fire hazards to the community with repeated fatal fire accidents reported every year. Since the battery charging can be anywhere with the customers, it is of significance to have a technical means to detect and alert the customers. In this paper, we propose an electric vehicle charging load (EVCL) disaggregation method based on non-intrusive load monitoring technology. First, a non-intrusive EVCL disaggregation method based on independent component analysis with reference method to extract the charging periods is proposed. Then, algorithms for estimating both amplitude and time of EVCL based on signal reconstruction are applied. Finally, a validation on a publicly available real-world dataset published by Pecan Street is carried out and evaluated with two performance metrics of F1$_\textrmscore$ and RMSE. The results show that the proposed method succeeds in EVCL extraction.},
