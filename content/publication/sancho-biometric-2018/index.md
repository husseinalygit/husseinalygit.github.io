abstract: The photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a biomedical signal that can be used to
  estimate volumetric blood flow changes in the peripheral circulation. During the
  past few years, several works have been published in order to assess the potential
  for PPGs to be used in biometric authentication systems, but results are inconclusive.
  In this paper we perform an analysis of the feasibility of using the PPG as a realistic
  biometric alternative in the long term. Several feature extractors (based on the
  time domain and the Karhunen–Loève transform) and matching metrics (Manhattan and
  Euclidean distances) have been tested using four different PPG databases (PRRB,
  MIMIC-II, Berry, and Nonin). We show that the false match rate (FMR) and false non-match
  rate (FNMR) values remain constant in different time instances for a selected threshold,
  which is essential for using the PPG for biometric authentication purposes. On the
  other hand, obtained equal error rate (EER) values for signals recorded during the
  same session range from 1.0% for high-quality signals recorded in controlled conditions
  to 8% for those recorded in conditions closer to real-world scenarios. Moreover,
  in certain scenarios, EER values rise up to 23.2% for signals recorded over different
  days, signaling that performance degradation could take place with time.
