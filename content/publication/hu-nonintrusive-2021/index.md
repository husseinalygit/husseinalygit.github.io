abstract: Monitoring the charging behavior of electric vehicle clusters will contribute
  to developing more effective energy management strategies for grid operators. A
  low implementation cost leads to a wide application prospect in nonintrusive monitoring
  for EVs. Aiming at the problem that traditional nonintrusive monitoring methods
  cannot identify unknown devices accurately due to the lack of classes, a nonintrusive
  monitoring method based on zero-shot learning (ZSL) is proposed in this article,
  one which can monitor the unknown types of EVs connected to charging piles. First,
  the charging characteristics of known EVs and unknown EVs are extracted by dictionary
  learning. Then EVs are classified by ZSL based on sparse coding. Furthermore, EVs
  are decomposed based on the proposed multimode factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM).
  Finally, the EV dataset of Pecan Street is used to verify the effectiveness and
  accuracy of the proposed method.
