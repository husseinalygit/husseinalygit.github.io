abstract: As the smart city applications are moving from conceptual models to development
  phase, smart transportation is one of smart cities applications and it is gaining
  ground nowadays. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are considered one of the major pillars
  of smart transportation applications. EVs are ever growing in popularity due to
  their potential contribution in reducing dependency on fossil fuels and greenhouse
  gas emissions. However, large-scale deployment of EV charging stations poses multiple
  challenges to the power grid and public infrastructure. To overcome the issue of
  prolonged charging time, the simple solution of deploying more charging stations
  to increase charging capacity does not work due to the strain on power grids and
  physical space limitations. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing smart
  scheduling algorithms to manage the demand for public charging using modeling and
  optimization. More recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven approaches
  in modeling EV charging. Consequently, researchers are looking to identify consumer
  charging behavior pattern that can provide insights and predictive analytics capability.
  The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review for the use of
  supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning as well as Deep Neural Networks for
  charging behavior analysis and prediction. Recommendations and future research directions
  are also discussed.
