abstract: As wearable technologies are being increasingly used for clinical research
  and healthcare, it is critical to understand their accuracy and determine how measurement
  errors may affect research conclusions and impact healthcare decision-making. Accuracy
  of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and
  popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible
  for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information
  about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements
  from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical method for
  measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in PPG
  stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts,
  and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy
  of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and
  PPG data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances
  to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically
  significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences
  between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during
  activity was, on average, 30% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate
  that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated
  heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes
  in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in
  drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions
  using these devices.
