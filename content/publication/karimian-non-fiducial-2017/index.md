abstract: Biometrics have a great deal of potential in healthcare applications, most
  notably authentication for medical record privacy and fraud prevention. In this
  paper, we examine, for the first time, non-fiducial feature extraction for photo-plethysmography
  (PPG) based authentication. PPG signals have unique identity properties for human
  authentication, and are becoming easier to capture by emerging IoT sensors such
  as MaxFast. Different machine learning techniques are used to compare non-fiducial
  and fiducial feature extractions. Our experimental results show that 99.84% accuracy
  with EER of 1.31% can be achieved based on non-fiducial feature extraction.
