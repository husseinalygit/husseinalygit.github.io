abstract: The aim of this study is to extract new features to show the relationship
  between speech recordings and blood pressure (BP). For this purpose, a database
  consisting of / a / vowels with different BP values under the same room and environment
  conditions is presented to the literature. Convolutional Neural Networks-Regression
  (CNN-R), Support Vector Machines-Regression (SVMs-R) and Multi Linear Regression
  (MLR) are used in this study to predict BP with extracted features. In the simulation
  studies, the highest accuracy rates of BP prediction from / a / vowel have been
  obtained based on Systolic BP values with CNN-R. The simulation outputs of the study
  yielded accuracy results in an acceptable margin. In the study, 89.43% for MLR,
  92.15% for SVM-R and 93.65% for CNN-R are obtained when ReliefF has been used. When
  the root mean square errors (RMSE) are considered, the lowest error rate is obtained
  with CNN-R as RMSE = 0.2355. In conclusion, it can be observed that the proposed
  feature vector (FVx) shows a relationship between BP and the human voices, and in
  this direction, it can be used as an FVx in a system which will be developed in
  order to follow the tension of individuals.
