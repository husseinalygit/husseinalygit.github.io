abstract: textlessptextgreaterAlthough the scientific literature contains numerous
  reports of the statistical accuracy of systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose
  (SMBG), most of these studies determine accuracy in ways that may not be clinically
  useful. We have developed an error grid analysis (EGA), which describes the clinical
  accuracy of SMBG systems over the entire range of blood glucose values, taking into
  account 1) the absolute value of the system-generated glucose value, 2) the absolute
  value of the reference blood glucose value, 3) the relative difference between these
  two values, and 4) the clinical significance of this difference. The EGA of accuracy
  of five different reflectance meters (Eyetone, Dextrometer, Glucometer I, Glucometer
  II, Memory Glucometer II), a visually interpretable glucose reagent strip (Glucostix),
  and filter-paper spot glucose determinations is presented. In addition, reanalyses
  of a laboratory comparison of three reflectance meters (Accucheck II, Glucometer
  II, Glucoscan 9000) and of two previously published studies comparing the accuracy
  of five different reflectance meters with EGA is described. EGA provides the practitioner
  and the researcher with a clinically meaningful method for evaluating the accuracy
  of blood glucose values generated with various monitoring systems and for analyzing
  the clinical implications of previously published data.textless/ptextgreater
