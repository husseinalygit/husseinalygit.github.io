abstract: As we race toward the Internet of Things (IoT), small embedded devices are
  increasingly becoming network-enabled. Often, these devices can't meet the computational
  requirements of current intrusion prevention mechanisms or designers prioritize
  additional features and services over security; as a result, many IoT devices are
  vulnerable to attack. We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly
  detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained IoT devices yet
  provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection
  uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise AND operation followed
  by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as
  a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation.
  Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware
  or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol
  stack of a device. We demonstrate near perfect payload discrimination for data captured
  from off the shelf IoT devices.
