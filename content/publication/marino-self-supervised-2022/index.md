abstract: 'Monitoring traffic in computer networks is one of the core approaches for
  defending critical infrastructure against cyber attacks. Machine Learning (ML) and
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proposed in the past as a tool to identify
  anomalies in computer networks. Although detecting these anomalies provides an indication
  of an attack, just detecting an anomaly is not enough information for a user to
  understand the anomaly. The black-box nature of off-the-shelf ML models prevents
  extracting important information that is fundamental to isolate the source of the
  fault/attack and take corrective measures. In this paper, we introduce the Network
  Transformer (NeT), a DNN model for anomaly detection that incorporates the graph
  structure of the communication network in order to improve interpretability. The
  presented approach has the following advantages: 1) enhanced interpretability by
  incorporating the graph structure of computer networks; 2) provides a hierarchical
  set of features that enables analysis at different levels of granularity; 3) self-supervised
  training that does not require labeled data. The presented approach was tested by
  evaluating the successful detection of anomalies in an Industrial Control System
  (ICS). The presented approach successfully identified anomalies, the devices affected,
  and the specific connections causing the anomalies, providing a data-driven hierarchical
  approach to analyze the behavior of a cyber network.'
