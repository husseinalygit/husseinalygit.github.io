abstract: NeuroKit2 is an open-source, community-driven, and user-centered Python
  package for neurophysiological signal processing. It provides a comprehensive suite
  of processing routines for a variety of bodily signals (e.g., ECG, PPG, EDA, EMG,
  RSP). These processing routines include high-level functions that enable data processing
  in a few lines of code using validated pipelines, which we illustrate in two examples
  covering the most typical scenarios, such as an event-related paradigm and an interval-related
  analysis. The package also includes tools for specific processing steps such as
  rate extraction and filtering methods, offering a trade-off between high-level convenience
  and fine-tuned control. Its goal is to improve transparency and reproducibility
  in neurophysiological research, as well as foster exploration and innovation. Its
  design philosophy is centred on user-experience and accessibility to both novice
  and advanced users.
