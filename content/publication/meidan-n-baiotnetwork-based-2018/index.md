abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices that can be more easily compromised than
  desktop computers has led to an increase in IoT-based botnet attacks. To mitigate
  this threat, there is a need for new methods that detect attacks launched from compromised
  IoT devices and that differentiate between hours- and milliseconds-long IoT-based
  attacks. In this article, we propose a novel network-based anomaly detection method
  for the IoT called N-BaIoT that extracts behavior snapshots of the network and uses
  deep autoencoders to detect anomalous network traffic from compromised IoT devices.
  To evaluate our method, we infected nine commercial IoT devices in our lab with
  two widely known IoT-based botnets, Mirai and BASHLITE. The evaluation results demonstrated
  our proposed methods ability to accurately and instantly detect the attacks as they
  were being launched from the compromised IoT devices that were part of a botnet.
