abstract: 'Botnets are an important security problem on the Internet. They continuously
  evolve their structure, protocols and attacks. This survey analyzes and compares
  the most important efforts carried out in a network-based detection area. It accomplishes
  four tasks: first, the comparison of previous surveys and the proposal of four new
  dimensions to analyze their classification schemes; second, a new classification
  and comparison of network-based botnet detection proposals, which includes the definition
  of 20 desired properties of every botnet detection paper; third, an extensive comparison
  between the most representative detection proposals; and fourth, the description
  of the most important problems and highlights in the area. We conclude that the
  area has achieved great advances so far, but there are still many open problems.
