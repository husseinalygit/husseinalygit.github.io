abstract: "We propose a new biometric based on the human body's response to an electric
  square pulse signal, that we call pulse-response. We explore how this biometric
  can be used to enhance security in the context of two example applications: (1)
  as an additional authentication mechanism in PIN entry systems, and (2) as a continuous
  authentication mechanism on a secure terminal. The pulse-response biometric is effective
  because each human body exhibits a unique response to a signal pulse applied at
  the palm of one hand, and measured at the palm of the other. Using a prototype setup,
  we show that users can be correctly identified, with high probability, in a matter
  of seconds. This identification mechanism integrates very well with other well-established
  methods and offers a reliable additional layer of additional security, either on
  a continuous basis or at login time. We build a proof-of-concept prototype and perform
  experiments to validate the feasability of using pulse-response as a biometric.
  Our results are very encuraging: we achieve accuracies of 100% over a static data
  set and 88% over a data set with samples taken over several weeks."
