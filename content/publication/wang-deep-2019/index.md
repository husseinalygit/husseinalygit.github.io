abstract: Smart meters provide large amounts of data and the value of this data is
  getting increased attention because a better understanding of the characteristics
  of consumers helps utilities and retailers implement more effective demand response
  programs and more personalized services. This paper investigates how such characteristics
  can be inferred from fine-grained smart meter data. A deep convolutional neural
  network (CNN) first automatically extracts features from massive load profiles.
  A support vector machine then identifies the characteristics of the consumers. Comprehensive
  comparisons with state-of-the-art and advanced machine learning techniques are conducted.
  Case studies on an Irish dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep
  CNN-based method, which achieves higher accuracy in identifying the socio-demographic
  information about the consumers.
