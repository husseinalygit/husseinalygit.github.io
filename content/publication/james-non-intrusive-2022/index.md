abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charger demand has increased from 1.44 kW to between
  3.3 kW and 17.2/19.2 kW [1] in the past 10 years – a 3 to 17/19 times the average
  consumption from a single home. By 2045 EV penetration will on average grow by 34
  times (GWh) from today in Southern California Edison’s (SCE) territory [2]. To develop
  a data-driven utility EV grid integration strategy, EV customer charging behaviors
  need to be well understood. The ability to disaggregate EV loads, or segregate EV
  loads from household loads, is very useful in supporting enterprise forecasting
  and distribution planning, developing distribution standards, and capital request
  justification for a utility general rate case. EV telemetry and individual metered
  EV loads are not always available to the utility. In this paper, we present a lightweight
  efficient EV disaggregation methodology, with several advantages using real power
  measurements from advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) meters and demonstrated the
  algorithm and utility applications at scale (approximately 62,000 customers), and
  showed how the results can support utilities’ strategic need to develop a reliable,
  affordable, and safe EV integration strategy.
