abstract: The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the
  operational burden on power grids during peak load periods. Identifying the charging
  patterns of residential EV clusters and quantifying their flexibility in demand
  response (DR) can help grid operators make effective regulatory decisions for balancing
  grid supply and load. In this study, statistical models are established for the
  charging patterns (charging start time, charging end time, and charge duration)
  of residential EVs. A training-free non-intrusive load extracting (NILE) algorithm
  is proposed. The algorithm is based on different load signatures and power block
  extremums, and can extract the EV load charged by different charging power. A price-based
  DR model is established to optimise the charging strategy of EVs, and the flexibility
  of EVs in DR is quantified according to the change of charging behaviour before
  and after optimisation. In addition, the validity of the NILE algorithm is verified
  with a real data set, and the flexibility of the EV cluster in different situations
  (seasons, weekdays, and weekends) is quantified based on the separated charging
  data.
