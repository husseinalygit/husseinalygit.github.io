abstract: Utilities are currently deploying smart electricity meters in millions of
  households worldwide to collect fine-grained electricity consumption data. We present
  an approach to automatically analyzing this data to enable personalized and scalable
  energy efficiency programs for private households. In particular, we develop and
  evaluate a system that uses supervised machine learning techniques to automatically
  estimate specific “characteristics” of a household from its electricity consumption.
  The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling,
  or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected
  from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years.
  Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible,
  as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70% over all households for many
  of the characteristics and even exceeds 80% for some of the characteristics. The
  findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to
  the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted
  energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer
  insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential
  for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications.
