abstract: 'Advanced persistent threat (APT) attack is a malicious attack type which
  has intentional and clear targets. This attack technique has become a challenge
  for information security systems of organizations, governments, and businesses.
  The approaches of using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze
  signs and abnormal behaviors of network traffic for detecting and preventing APT
  attacks have become popular in recent years. However, the APT attack detection approach
  that uses behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties
  due to the lack of typical data of attack campaigns. To handle this situation, recent
  studies have selected and extracted the APT attack behaviors which based on datasets
  are built from experimental tools. Consequently, these properties are few and difficult
  to obtain in practical monitoring systems. Therefore, although the experimental
  results show good detection, it does not bring high efficiency in practice. For
  above reasons, in this paper, a new method based on network traffic analysis using
  a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks will be proposed. Specifically,
  individual deep learning networks such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional
  neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) will also be sought, built
  and linked into combined deep learning networks to analyze and detect signs of APT
  attacks in network traffic. To detect APT attack signals, the combined deep learning
  models are performed in two main stages including (i) extracting IP features based
  on flow: In this phase, we will analyze network traffic into networking flows by
  IP address and then use the combined deep learning models to extract IP features
  by network flow; (ii) classifying APT attack IPs: Based on IP features extracted
  in a task (i), the APT attack IPs and normal IPs will be identified and classified.
  The proposal of a combined deep learning model to detect APT attacks based on network
  traffic is a new approach, and there is no research proposed and applied yet. In
  the experimental section, combined deep learning models proved their superior abilities
  to ensure accuracy on all measurements from 93 to 98%. This is a very good result
  for APT attack detection based on network traffic.'
