abstract: Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques are increasingly becoming
  a key instrument for identifying the power consumption of individual appliances
  based on a single metering point. Particularly, deep learning (DL) models are gaining
  interest in this regard. However, the challenges brought by the NILM datasets and
  the nonavailability of common experimental guidelines tend to compromise comparison,
  research transparency, and replicability. The limited adoption of efficient research
  instruments and lack of best practices guidelines contribute in huge part to this
  problem, where no features, encouraging standardized formats for benchmarking, and
  results sharing are offered. To address these issues, we first present a brief overview
  of recent best practices for DL and highlight how deep NILM research can benefit
  from these practices. Furthermore, we suggest a novel open-source toolkit leveraging
  these practices, i.e., Deep-NILMTK. The proposed toolkit offers a common testing
  bed for NILM algorithms independently of the underlying deep learning framework
  with a modular NILM pipeline that can easily be customized. Furthermore, Deep-NILMTK
  introduces the concept of experiment templating to offer predesigned experiments
  allowing to enhancing research efficiency. Leveraging this concept and DL best practices,
  we present a case study of creating an online NILM benchmark repository1 considering
  eight of the most popular deep NILM algorithms. All sources relative to the tool
  are made publicly available on Github2 along with the corresponding documentation.
