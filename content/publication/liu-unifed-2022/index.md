abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a practical and popular paradigm in machine
  learning. However, currently, there is no systematic solution that covers diverse
  use cases. Practitioners often face the challenge of how to select a matching FL
  framework for their use case. In this work, we present UniFed, the first unified
  benchmark for standardized evaluation of the existing open-source FL frameworks.
  With 15 evaluation scenarios, we present both qualitative and quantitative evaluation
  results of nine existing popular open-sourced FL frameworks, from the perspectives
  of functionality, usability, and system performance. We also provide suggestions
  on framework selection based on the benchmark conclusions and point out future improvement
  directions.
