abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) technology has been used to develop small, wearable,
  pulse rate sensors. These devices, consisting of infrared light-emitting diodes
  (LEDs) and photodetectors, offer a simple, reliable, low-cost means of monitoring
  the pulse rate noninvasively. Recent advances in optical technology have facilitated
  the use of high-intensity green LEDs for PPG, increasing the adoption of this measurement
  technique. In this review, we briefly present the history of PPG and recent developments
  in wearable pulse rate sensors with green LEDs. The application of wearable pulse
  rate monitors is discussed.
