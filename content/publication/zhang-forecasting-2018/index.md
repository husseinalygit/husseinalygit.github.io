abstract: With the development of smart electricity metering technologies, huge amounts
  of consumption data can be retrieved on a daily and hourly basis. Energy consumption
  forecasting facilitates electricity demand management and utilities load planning.
  Most studies have been focussed on commercial customers or residential building-level
  energy consumption, or have used behavioral and occupancy sensor data to characterize
  an individual household's electrical consumption. This study has analyzed energy
  consumption at single household level using smart meter data to improve residential
  energy services and gain insights into planning demand response programs. Electricity
  consumption for anonymous individual households has been predicted using a Support
  Vector Regression (SVR) modelling with both daily and hourly data granularity. The
  electricity usage data set for 2014 to 2016 was obtained from a Canadian utility
  company. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used for data visualization and feature
  selection. The analysis presented here demonstrates that forecasting residential
  energy consumption for individual households is feasible, but the accuracy is highly
  dependable on household behaviour variability.
