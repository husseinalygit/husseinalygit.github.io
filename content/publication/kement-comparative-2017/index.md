abstract: A key enabler for the smart grid is the fine-grained monitoring of power
  utilization. Although such a mechanism is helpful in the optimization of the whole
  electricity generation, distribution, and consumption cycle, it also creates opportunities
  for the potential adversaries in deducing the activities and habits of the subscribers.
  In fact, by utilizing the standard and readily available tools of nonintrusive load
  monitoring (NILM) techniques on the metered electricity data, many details of customers'
  personal lives can be easily discovered. Therefore, prevention of such adversarial
  exploitations is of utmost importance for privacy protection. One strong privacy
  preservation approach is the modification of the metered data through the use of
  on-site storage units in conjunction with renewable energy resources. In this study,
  we introduce a novel mathematical programming framework to model eight privacy-enhanced
  power-scheduling strategies inspired and elicited from the literature. We employ
  all the relevant techniques for the modification of the actual electricity utilization
  (i.e., on-site battery, renewable energy resources, and appliance load moderation).
  Our evaluation framework is the first in the literature, to the best of our knowledge,
  for a comprehensive and fair comparison of the load-shaping techniques for privacy
  preservation. In addition to the privacy concerns, we consider monetary cost and
  disutility of the users in our objective functions. Evaluation results show that
  privacy preservation strategies in the literature differ significantly in terms
  of privacy, cost, and disutility metrics.
