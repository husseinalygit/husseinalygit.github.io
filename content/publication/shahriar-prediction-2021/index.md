abstract: As a key pillar of smart transportation in smart city applications, electric
  vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular for their contribution in reducing
  greenhouse gas emissions. One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power
  grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this
  lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public
  charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn
  the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused
  on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure
  time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events,
  which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations,
  and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of
  historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to
  predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning
  algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best
  predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores
  of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which
  improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate
  a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight
  the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.
