abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have been a major challenge in securing
  both Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Due to
  their capability to navigates around defenses and to evade detection for a prolonged
  period of time, targeted APT attacks present an increasing concern for both cyber
  security and business continuity personnel. This paper explores the application
  of Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) variants
  for APT detection. It has been shown that the variants of the suggested algorithms
  provide not only detection capability, but can also classify malicious data traffic
  with respect to the type of APT attacks.
