abstract: Masses of user-side smart meter data provide a foundation for utilities
  to acquire usersâ€™ electricity consumption patterns and promote refined energy management.
  Therefore, the charging load of electric vehicles can be identified non-intrusively
  through the smart meter data of residential users, which provides flexible resources
  for the demand side response of power grid enterprises and is beneficial to the
  power dispatching decision making. Meanwhile, revealing residential energy consumption
  behavior from smart meter data is treated as energy privacy leakage. Extensive data
  collection from smart meters has raised privacy risk, which could lead to the reduction
  of trust in utilities from households. Aiming at this problem, the paper proposes
  a non-intrusive method to extract residential electric vehicles, and on this basis,
  discusses the privacy protection. In this paper, DWT method is used to decompose
  the total power of smart meter to extract the charging load of electric vehicle,
  and similar charging load patterns are added to smart meter data to preserve the
  residential EV charging behavior privacy. Practical households with EVs are used
  to test the proposed method and the result shows its feasibility for the performance
  of privacy-preserving.
