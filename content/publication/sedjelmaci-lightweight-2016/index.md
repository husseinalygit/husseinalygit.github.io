abstract: In the Internet of Things (IoT), resources' constrained tiny sensors and
  devices could be connected to unreliable and untrusted networks. Nevertheless, securing
  IoT technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices.
  Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers
  with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining
  the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and
  low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly
  detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior
  of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected,
  it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection
  technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection
  for low-resource IoT devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically
  when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help
  of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature
  is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy
  consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach
  requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e.
  high detection and low false positive rates).
