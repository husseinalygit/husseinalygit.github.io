abstract: Smart grids are becoming more common due to their capacity to accommodate
  secondary sources, like green energies from solar panels or wind farms. However,
  the attack surface also grows with more equipment in the network, making it necessary
  to secure appropriately. With more sensors distributed on the network, it becomes
  easier for an attacker to hack into one and send false information to the central
  to destabilize the power generation and distribution. Load-altering attacks do precisely
  that and have a destructive potential since the generator reaction can cause network
  instability. Traditional techniques, like those based on the Kalman filter, for
  example, may pose numerical issues due to the large size and sparsity of the system
  matrices, failing to provide good results or wasting computational resources. We
  propose an LMI-based approach to design a bank of residual generators for functional
  observers to detect such attacks. This approach has the advantage of using a reduced
  order arbitrary dynamic system, making it suitable for large-scale smart grids,
  and the use of LMI, allowing the easy insertion of restrictions.
