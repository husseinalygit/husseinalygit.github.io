abstract: Traditional one-time user authentication processes might cause friction
  and unfavorable user experience in many widely-used applications. This is a severe
  problem in particular for security-sensitive facilities if an adversary could obtain
  unauthorized privileges after a user's initial login. Recently, continuous user
  authentication (CA) has shown its great potential by enabling seamless user authentication
  with few active participation. We devise a low-cost system exploiting a user's pulsatile
  signals from the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in commercial wrist-worn wearables
  for CA. Compared to existing approaches, our system requires zero user effort and
  is applicable to practical scenarios with non-clinical PPG measurements having motion
  artifacts (MA). We explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system and design
  an MA filtering method to mitigate the impacts of daily activities. Furthermore,
  we identify general fiducial features and develop an adaptive classifier using the
  gradient boosting tree (GBT) method. As a result, our system can authenticate users
  continuously based on their cardiac characteristics so little training effort is
  required. Experiments with our wrist-worn PPG sensing platform on 20 participants
  under practical scenarios demonstrate that our system can achieve a high CA accuracy
  of over 90% and a low false detection rate of 4% in detecting random attacks.
