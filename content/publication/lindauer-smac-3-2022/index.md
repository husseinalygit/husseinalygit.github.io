abstract: Algorithm parameters, in particular hyperparameters of machine learning
  algorithms, can substantially impact their performance. To support users in determining
  well-performing hyperparameter configurations for their algorithms, datasets and
  applications at hand, SMAC3 offers a robust and flexible framework for Bayesian
  Optimization, which can improve performance within a few evaluations. It offers
  several facades and pre-sets for typical use cases, such as optimizing hyperparameters,
  solving low dimensional continuous (artificial) global optimization problems and
  configuring algorithms to perform well across multiple problem instances. The SMAC3
  package is available under a permissive BSD-license at https://github.com/automl/SMAC3.
