abstract: Upper limb amputation is a condition that significantly restricts the amputees
  from performing their daily activities. The myoelectric prosthesis, using signals
  from residual stump muscles, is aimed at restoring the function of such lost limbs
  seamlessly. Unfortunately, the acquisition and use of such myosignals are cumbersome
  and complicated. Furthermore, once acquired, it usually requires heavy computational
  power to turn it into a user control signal. Its transition to a practical prosthesis
  solution is still being challenged by various factors particularly those related
  to the fact that each amputee has different mobility, muscle contraction forces,
  limb positional variations and electrode placements. Thus, a solution that can adapt
  or otherwise tailor itself to each individual is required for maximum utility across
  amputees. Modified machine learning schemes for pattern recognition have the potential
  to significantly reduce the factors (movement of users and contraction of the muscle)
  affecting the traditional electromyography (EMG)-pattern recognition methods. Although
  recent developments of intelligent pattern recognition techniques could discriminate
  multiple degrees of freedom with high-level accuracy, their efficiency level was
  less accessible and revealed in real-world (amputee) applications. This review paper
  examined the suitability of upper limb prosthesis (ULP) inventions in the healthcare
  sector from their technical control perspective. More focus was given to the review
  of real-world applications and the use of pattern recognition control on amputees.
  We first reviewed the overall structure of pattern recognition schemes for myo-control
  prosthetic systems and then discussed their real-time use on amputee upper limbs.
  Finally, we concluded the paper with a discussion of the existing challenges and
  future research recommendations.
