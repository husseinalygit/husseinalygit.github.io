abstract: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are stealthy, sophisticated, and unpredictable
  cyberattacks that can steal intellectual property, damage critical infrastructure,
  or cause millions of dollars in damage. Detecting APTs by monitoring system-level
  activity is difficult because manually inspecting the high volume of normal system
  activity is overwhelming for security analysts. We evaluate the effectiveness of
  unsupervised batch and streaming anomaly detection algorithms over multiple gigabytes
  of provenance traces recorded on four different operating systems to determine whether
  they can detect realistic APT-like attacks reliably and efficiently. This article
  is the first detailed study of the effectiveness of generic unsupervised anomaly
  detection techniques in this setting.
