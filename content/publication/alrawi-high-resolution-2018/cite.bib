 abstract = {In Qatar, nearly 60% of the electricity is consumed in the domestic sector, yet very little is known about behind the meter electricity consumption. In this paper, we present and analyze electricity load measurements taken at ten houses in Qatar. We installed Smappee energy monitors at each house and recorded the measurements at 5-min intervals. This study includes measurements from July to November 2017. Results indicate that air-conditioning dominates residential consumption. Furthermore, the size of the house and the air conditioning type are the main determinants of the electricity consumption for summer months, while in winter months the difference in consumption per capita diminishes significantly. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the first study that presents behind the meter electricity consumption data in Qatar and in the GCC region. Such results will be used in future research activities such as designing PV rooftop-energy storage systems and demand response programs.},
