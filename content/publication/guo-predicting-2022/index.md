abstract: We use machine learning algorithms to investigate various aspects of residential
  electricity consumption for households in the Republic of Ireland. Temperature,
  day of week, and month of year have an apparent causal effect on consumption. The
  prevalence of six distinct intra-day load profiles, identified by clustering, changes
  dramatically between weekdays and weekends as well as seasonally. Key socio-demographic
  and dwelling characteristics associated with annual load profiles include household
  makeup and size and occupation of the primary income earner. We further discuss
  policy and management implications of our findings and propose avenues for future
  research.
