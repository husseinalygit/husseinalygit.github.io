abstract: Electrification of transport systems is a key to decarbonize the economy
  and mitigate climate change. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are used to electrify the transport
  systems. But charging of EVs raises concerns for power grids, such as load unbalance
  and voltage fluctuations. Therefore, distributed network operators need to have
  full visibility on the EVs in the network. This requires identifying which consumer
  has an EV. Smart meter devices collect electricity consumption of consumers, which
  can be potentially used to identify whether own an EV that is charge at home. Currently,
  the EV owners are in minority and data is heavily unbalanced meaning that the number
  of EV owners is much less than those without. In this paper, we propose an outlier
  detection-based method that does not use a supervised learning to identify EV owners.
  The proposed model uses temporal information from smart meter time series. The performance
  of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art resampling-based methods
  in terms of F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. We use real-world data
  to evaluate the performance.
