 abstract = {Electrification of transport systems is a key to decarbonize the economy and mitigate climate change. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are used to electrify the transport systems. But charging of EVs raises concerns for power grids, such as load unbalance and voltage fluctuations. Therefore, distributed network operators need to have full visibility on the EVs in the network. This requires identifying which consumer has an EV. Smart meter devices collect electricity consumption of consumers, which can be potentially used to identify whether own an EV that is charge at home. Currently, the EV owners are in minority and data is heavily unbalanced meaning that the number of EV owners is much less than those without. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection-based method that does not use a supervised learning to identify EV owners. The proposed model uses temporal information from smart meter time series. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art resampling-based methods in terms of F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. We use real-world data to evaluate the performance.},
