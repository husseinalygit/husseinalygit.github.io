abstract: Hypoglycemia is a condition caused by low blood glucose levels, mainly affecting
  people with diabetes. Low levels of blood glucose can be dangerous, causing multiple
  complications over time. Hypoglycemia affects the repolarization characteristics
  of the heart. This study presents a personalized, deep learning-based approach that
  enables nocturnal hypoglycemia detection using raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals,
  recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices. The study was carried out in a calorimeter
  room during 24–36 h monitoring on twenty-five, healthy, elderly participants. The
  results of this study (accuracy of ≈90%) provide evidence for the feasibility of
  a non-invasive, ECG-based hypoglycemia alarming system. Moreover, leveraging an
  unsupervised method (i.e. convolutional denoising autoencoder) and visualizing the
  ECG heartbeats in the embeddings space, clear heartbeats clusters grouped by glucose
  levels could be determined, showing that specific patterns in the input heartbeats
  are indeed glucose discriminative and the autoencoder could successfully capture
  those patterns.
