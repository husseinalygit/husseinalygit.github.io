abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a non-contact biometric system
  with photoplethysmogram (PPG). A novel method for non-contact PPG acquisition based
  on the Laplacian pyramid is proposed in this paper with the authentication module
  based on the deep neural network (DNN). Laplacian pyramid based video amplification
  technique extracts the subtle changes of blood volume as a result of the cardiovascular
  activities in the facial region. The video data was recorded from 20 subjects in
  varying light conditions at different places, resembling different scenarios in
  the generalized environment. Authentication accuracy ranges from 66.67% to 100%
  with an average of 86.67%. In order to validate the repeatability of PPG waveforms,
  a comparative analysis of the correlation coefficients for the waveforms recorded
  over a month are conducted.
