abstract: Objective. Fetal heart rate (HR) monitoring is routinely used during pregnancy
  and labor to assess fetal well-being. The noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG),
  obtained by electrodes on the maternal abdomen, is a promising alternative to standard
  fetal monitoring. Subtraction of the maternal ECG from the abdominal measurements
  results in fetal ECG signals, in which the fetal HR can be determined typically
  through R-peak detection. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and the nonstationary
  nature of the fetal ECG make R-peak detection a challenging task. Approach. We propose
  an alternative approach that instead of performing R-peak detection employs deep
  learning to directly determine the fetal HR from the extracted fetal ECG signals.
  We introduce a combination of dilated inception convolutional neural networks (CNN)
  with long short-term memory networks to capture both short-term and long-term temporal
  dynamics of the fetal HR. The robustness of the method is reinforced by a separate
  CNN-based classifier that estimates the reliability of the outcome. Main results.
  Our method achieved a positive percent agreement (within 10% of the actual fetal
  HR value) of 97.3% on a dataset recorded during labor and 99.6% on set-A of the
  2013 Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge exceeding top-performing state-of-the-art
  algorithms from the literature. Significance. The proposed method can potentially
  improve the accuracy and robustness of fetal HR extraction in clinical practice.
