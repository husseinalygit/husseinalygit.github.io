 abstract = {Objective. Fetal heart rate (HR) monitoring is routinely used during pregnancy and labor to assess fetal well-being. The noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG), obtained by electrodes on the maternal abdomen, is a promising alternative to standard fetal monitoring. Subtraction of the maternal ECG from the abdominal measurements results in fetal ECG signals, in which the fetal HR can be determined typically through R-peak detection. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and the nonstationary nature of the fetal ECG make R-peak detection a challenging task. Approach. We propose an alternative approach that instead of performing R-peak detection employs deep learning to directly determine the fetal HR from the extracted fetal ECG signals. We introduce a combination of dilated inception convolutional neural networks (CNN) with long short-term memory networks to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dynamics of the fetal HR. The robustness of the method is reinforced by a separate CNN-based classifier that estimates the reliability of the outcome. Main results. Our method achieved a positive percent agreement (within 10% of the actual fetal HR value) of 97.3% on a dataset recorded during labor and 99.6% on set-A of the 2013 Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge exceeding top-performing state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. Significance. The proposed method can potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of fetal HR extraction in clinical practice.},
