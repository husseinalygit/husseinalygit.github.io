The root mean sum of the squared differences between R–R intervals (rMSSD) was determined from each device. \textlessem\textgreater\textlessstrong\textgreaterResults:\textless/strong\textgreater\textless/em\textgreater Compared to ECG, the technical error of estimate (TEE) was acceptable for all conditions (average TEE CV% [90% CI] = 6.35 [5.13; 8.5]). When assessed as a standardized difference, all differences were deemed “trivial” (average standard difference [90% CI] = 0.10 [0.08; 0.13]). Both PPG- and heart-rate-sensor-derived measures had almost perfect correlations with ECG (\textlessem\textgreaterR\textless/em\textgreater = 1.00 [0.99; 1.00]). \textlessem\textgreater\textlessstrong\textgreaterConclusion:\textless/strong\textgreater\textless/em\textgreater Both PPG and heart-rate sensors provide an acceptable agreement for the measurement of rMSSD when compared with ECG. Smartphone PPG technology may be a preferred method of HRV data collection for athletes due to its practicality and ease of use in the field.\textless/p\textgreater\textless/section\textgreater},
