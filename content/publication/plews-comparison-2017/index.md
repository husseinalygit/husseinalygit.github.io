  To establish the validity of smartphone photoplethysmography (PPG) and heart-rate
  sensor in the measurement of heart-rate variability (HRV). 
  textlessemtextgreatertextlessstrongtextgreaterMethods:textless/strongtextgreatertextless/emtextgreater
  29 healthy subjects were measured at rest during 5 min of guided breathing and normal
  breathing using smartphone PPG, a heart-rate chest strap, and electrocardiography
  (ECG). The root mean sum of the squared differences between R–R intervals (rMSSD)
  was determined from each device.

  Compared to ECG, the technical error of estimate (TEE) was acceptable for all conditions
  (average TEE CV% [90% CI] = 6.35 [5.13; 8.5]). When assessed as a standardized difference,
  all differences were deemed “trivial” (average standard difference [90% CI] = 0.10
  [0.08; 0.13]). Both PPG- and heart-rate-sensor-derived measures had almost perfect
  correlations with ECG (textlessemtextgreaterRtextless/emtextgreater = 1.00 [0.99;
  1.00]). 
  textlessemtextgreatertextlessstrongtextgreaterConclusion:textless/strongtextgreatertextless/emtextgreater
  Both PPG and heart-rate sensors provide an acceptable agreement for the measurement
  of rMSSD when compared with ECG. Smartphone PPG technology may be a preferred method
  of HRV data collection for athletes due to its practicality and ease of use in the
