 abstract = {The consumption data from smart meters and complex questionnaires reveals the electricity consumers’ willingness to adapt their lifestyle to reduce or change their behaviour in electricity usage to flatten the peak in electricity consumption and release the stress in the power grid. Thus, the electricity consumption can support the enforcement of tariff and demand response strategies. Although the plethora of complex, unstructured and heterogeneous data is collected from various devices connected to the Internet, smart meters, plugs, sensors and complex questionnaires, there is an undoubted challenge to handle the data flow that does not provide much information as it remains unprocessed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an innovative methodology that organizes and extracts valuable information from the increasing volume of data, such as data about the electricity consumption measured and recorded at 30 min intervals, as well as data collected from complex questionnaires.},
