abstract: The consumption data from smart meters and complex questionnaires reveals
  the electricity consumers’ willingness to adapt their lifestyle to reduce or change
  their behaviour in electricity usage to flatten the peak in electricity consumption
  and release the stress in the power grid. Thus, the electricity consumption can
  support the enforcement of tariff and demand response strategies. Although the plethora
  of complex, unstructured and heterogeneous data is collected from various devices
  connected to the Internet, smart meters, plugs, sensors and complex questionnaires,
  there is an undoubted challenge to handle the data flow that does not provide much
  information as it remains unprocessed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an innovative
  methodology that organizes and extracts valuable information from the increasing
  volume of data, such as data about the electricity consumption measured and recorded
  at 30 min intervals, as well as data collected from complex questionnaires.
