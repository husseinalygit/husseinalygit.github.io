abstract: 'Objective This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate
  of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood
  pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The
  method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not
  need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology The architecture of the system
  consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal
  processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning
  algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the
  system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform
  and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results As described in this paper we
  tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration.
  The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques
  tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support
  vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random
  forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination
  for reference vs. prediction were RSBP2=0.91, RDBP2=0.89, and RBGL2=0.90. For the
  glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7%
  of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B, and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values
  complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion
  An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph
  is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies
  with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure
  and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.'
