abstract: High penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) has resulted in an increasing
  need for charging infrastructure and efficient smart charging coordination of EVs.
  In addition to residential and public charging, destination charging is another
  important mode of EV charging, and it has the potential to cover residual public
  charging demand. Understanding of the factors and charging coordination strategies
  that ensure a sustainable destination charging business is therefore of utmost importance.
  Literature on the topic of EV smart charging and coordination is growing exponentially,
  but the terminology used to describe coordination strategies remained ambiguous.
  Hence, this paper systematically classifies the literature focused on the destination
  charging. In doing so, various charging tariffs and business models associated with
  destination charging are reviewed and a comprehensive discussion on their profitability
  and availability is provided. Recent EV charging coordination strategies are reviewed
  and categorized to clarify the commonly used terminology. Destination charging coordination
  strategies are then classified, and real-world charging coordination initiatives
  are reviewed and summarized. The analysis contained in this paper shows that further
  research work on charging coordination for destination charging should account for
  user behavior and the potential obstacles faced by the intended scale of destination
  charging to determine a suitable coordination strategy. It is also recognized that
  implicit charging coordination strategies are understudied and should be investigated
  because they may circumvent problems encountered by real-world EV charging coordination
  programs.
