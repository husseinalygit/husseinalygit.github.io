abstract: Smart-grid (SG) is a new revolution in the electrical utility industry (EUI)
  over the past decade. With each moving day, some new advanced technologies are coming
  into the picture which forces the utility engineers to think about its application
  to make the electrical grid become smarter. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
  such as machine learning (ML), artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning (DL),
  reinforcement learning (RL), and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) are the few examples
  of above-mentioned advanced technologies by which large volume of collected information
  being processed, and deliver the solution to the complex problems associated with
  EUI. In recent times, DL for artificial intelligence applications has gained huge
  attention in the diverse research area. The traditional ML techniques have several
  constrained for processing the data in raw form. However, the DL provides the options
  to process the raw data without extracting and selecting the feature vector. The
  DL techniques belong to a new era of AI development. This article presents the taxonomy
  of DL algorithms available in the literature applied to different problems in EUI.
  The main objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive idea to the researcher/utility
  engineer about the applications and future research scope of DL methods for power
  systems studies.
