abstract: Hypertension or high blood pressure is a leading cause of death throughout
  the world and a critical factor for increasing the risk of serious diseases, including
  cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart failure. Blood pressure is a primary
  vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the early detection, prevention
  and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement
  techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent,
  and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches
  using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time,
  pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to
  utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal processing
  techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, have also opened
  up exciting new horizons for PPG-based cuff less and continuous monitoring of blood
  pressure. Such a device will have a significant and transformative impact in monitoring
  patientsâ€™ vital signs, especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This
  paper provides a comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure
  estimation using the PPG approach along with their challenges and limitations.
