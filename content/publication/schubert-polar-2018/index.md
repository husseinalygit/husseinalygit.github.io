abstract: 'Purpose Traditional heart-rate monitoring through the use of electrocardiograms
  or chest-worn heart rate sensors can be challenging in certain sports or in field
  settings. New technologies, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), have enabled heart-rate
  monitoring at alternate sites. However, to date, the accuracy and validity of various
  PPG sensors has not been examined in detail. The purpose of the present investigation
  was to determine the validity of an arm-worn PPG sensor during yoga sequences. Methods
  Fifteen college-aged men and women participated in a ~45 min power vinyasa yoga
  class. During the class, participants wore Polar® H7 chest straps and RCX3 receivers
  (criterion) and Polar® OH1 arm bands on their upper right arm (practical). Mean
  differences were compared via a paired t-test, heart rate during yoga using a time*device
  repeated measures ANOVA, and agreement assessed with Bland-Altman analysis. Results
  Mean heart rates during yoga were not different (mean difference=0.76, 95% CI: –0.54
  to 2.06; p=0.229). Yoga created a main effect of time on heart rate (ptextless0.0001),
  but there was no difference between devices (p=0.86) or interaction (p=0.90). Mean
  bias±95% limits of agreement was 0.76±1.30 bpm, with a typical error of 2.42±1.49
  bpm and a coefficient of variation of 1.8±1.5%. Conclusions Results of the present
  investigation revealed that the Polar® OH1 is a valid measure of heart rate during
  moderate-vigorous exercise. Future validation studies should consider other exercise
  modes and participant characteristics.'
