abstract: The development of smartphones equipped with accelerometers gives a promising
  way for researchers to accurately recognize an individualâ€™s physical activity in
  order to better understand the relationship between physical activity and health.
  However, a huge challenge for such sensor-based activity recognition task is the
  collection of annotated or labelled training data. In this work, we employ an unsupervised
  method for recognizing physical activities using smartphone accelerometers. Features
  are extracted from the raw acceleration data collected by smartphones, then an unsupervised
  classification method called MCODE is used for activity recognition. We evaluate
  the effectiveness of our method on three real-world datasets, i.e., a public dataset
  of daily living activities and two datasets of sports activities of race walking
  and basketball playing collected by ourselves, and we find our method outperforms
  other existing methods. The results show that our method is viable to recognize
  physical activities using smartphone accelerometers.
