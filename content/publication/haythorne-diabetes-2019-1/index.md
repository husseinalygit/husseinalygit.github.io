abstract: 'Diabetes is a global health problem caused primarily by the inability of
  pancreatic β-cells to secrete adequate levels of insulin. The molecular mechanisms
  underlying the progressive failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in type-2 diabetes
  remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find
  significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic βV59M
  mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved
  in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative
  phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases
  in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism
  are reduced. INS-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes
  in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted
  metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces
  metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and ATP
  synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of β-cells in diabetes.'
