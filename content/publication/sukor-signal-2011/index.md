abstract: Pulse oximetry has been extensively used to estimate oxygen saturation in
  blood, a vital physiological parameter commonly used when monitoring a subject's
  health status. However, accurate estimation of this parameter is difficult to achieve
  when the fundamental signal from which it is derived, the photoplethysmograph (PPG),
  is contaminated with noise artifact induced by movement of the subject or the measurement
  apparatus. This study presents a novel method for automatic rejection of artifact
  contaminated pulse oximetry waveforms, based on waveform morphology analysis. The
  performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually annotated gold standard.
  The creation of the gold standard involved two experts identifying sections of the
  PPG signal containing good quality PPG pulses and/or noise, in 104 fingertip PPG
  signals, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph (ECG) signal as a reference signal.
  The fingertip PPG signals were each 1 min in duration and were acquired from 13
  healthy subjects (10 males and 3 females). Each signal contained approximately 20
  s of purposely induced artifact noise from a variety of activities involving subject
  movement. Some unique waveform morphology features were extracted from the PPG signals,
  which were believed to be correlated with signal quality. A simple decision-tree
  classifier was employed to arrive at a classification decision, at a pulse-by-pulse
  resolution, of whether a pulse was of acceptable quality for use or not. The performance
  of the algorithm was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity,
  specificity and accuracy measures. A mean κ of 0.64 ± 0.22 was obtained, while the
  mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89 ± 10%, 77 ± 19% and 83 ± 11%,
  respectively. Furthermore, a heart rate estimate, extracted from uncontaminated
  sections of PPG, as identified by the algorithm, was compared with the heart rate
  derived from an uncontaminated simultaneous ECG signal. The mean error between both
  heart rate readings was 0.49 ± 0.66 beats per minute (BPM), in comparison to an
  error value observed without using the artifact detection algorithm of 7.23 ± 5.78
  BPM. These results demonstrate that automated identification of signal artifact
  in the PPG signal through waveform morphology analysis is achievable. In addition,
  a clear improvement in the accuracy of the derived heart rate is also evident when
  such methods are employed.
