abstract: This database includes 12 half-hour ECG recordings and 3 half-hour recordings
  of noise typical in ambulatory ECG recordings. The noise recordings were made using
  physically active volunteers and standard ECG recorders, leads, and electrodes;
  the electrodes were placed on the limbs in positions in which the subjectsâ€™ ECGs
  were not visible.
