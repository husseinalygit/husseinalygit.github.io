abstract: The popularization of electric vehicles raises concerns about their negative
  impact on the electrical grid. Extracting electric vehicle charging load patterns
  is a key factor that allows smart grid operators to make intelligent and informed
  decisions about conserving energy and promoting the stability of the electrical
  grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract electric vehicle
  charging load patterns nonintrusively from the smart meter data. Furthermore, a
  method to define flexibility for the collective electric vehicle charging demand
  by analyzing the time-variable patterns of the aggregated electric vehicle charging
  behaviors is presented. Validation results on real residential loads have shown
  that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract electric vehicle charging
  loads and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances
  that have similar load behaviors as electric vehicles. Furthermore, a case study
  on real residential data to analyze electric vehicle charging trends and quantify
  the flexibility achievable from the aggregated electric vehicle load in different
  time periods is presented.
