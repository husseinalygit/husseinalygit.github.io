abstract: We propose a methodology to detect the current status of a poweredon drone
  ( ying or at rest), leveraging just the communication tra c exchanged between the
  drone and its Remote Controller (RC). Our solution, other than being the rst of
  its kind, does not require either any special hardware or to transmit any signal;
  it is built applying standard classi cation algorithms to the eavesdropped tra c,
  analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. Moreover, it is
  fully passive and it resorts to cheap and general purpose hardware. To evaluate
  the e ectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication measurements from
  a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source rmware, mounted onboard on
  a wide range of commercial amateur drones. e results prove that our methodology
  can e ciently and e ectively identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e.,
  if it is ying or lying on the ground. In addition, we estimate a lower bound on
  the time required to identify the status of a drone with the requested level of
  assurance. e quality and viability of our solution do prove that network tra c analysis
  can be successfully adopted for drone status identi cation, and pave the way for
  future research in the area.
