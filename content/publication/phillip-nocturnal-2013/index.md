abstract: Intensive insulin therapy is considered to be the standard treatment for
  tight blood glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes, since it prevents
  long-term complications. Several studies have promoted the use of insulin pumps,
  glucose sensors, or a combination of the two devices (sensor-augmented pump)1–3
  to improve glucose control. However, the risk of hypoglycemia is still present with
  the use of all currently available therapies.4–6 Maintenance of nocturnal euglycemia
  is extremely important and is challenging, since most cases of severe hypoglycemia
  occur at night.7,8 Such episodes account for 75% of total hypoglycemic seizures
  in children9 and . . .
