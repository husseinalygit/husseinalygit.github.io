abstract: Network intrusion detection is one of the most important parts for cyber
  security to protect computer systems against malicious attacks. With the emergence
  of numerous sophisticated and new attacks, however, network intrusion detection
  techniques are facing several significant challenges. The overall objective of this
  study is to learn useful feature representations automatically and efficiently from
  large amounts of unlabeled raw network traffic data by using deep learning approaches.
  We propose a novel network intrusion model by stacking dilated convolutional autoencoders
  and evaluate our method on two new intrusion detection datasets. Several experiments
  were carried out to check the effectiveness of our approach. The comparative experimental
  results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve considerably high performance
  which meets the demand of high accuracy and adaptability of network intrusion detection
  systems (NIDSs). It is quite potential and promising to apply our model in the large-scale
  and real-world network environments.
