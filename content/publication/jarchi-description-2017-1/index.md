abstract: Wearable heart rate sensors such as those found in smartwatches are commonly
  based upon Photoplethysmography (PPG) which shines a light into the wrist and measures
  the amount of light reflected back. This method works well for stationary subjects,
  but in exercise situations, PPG signals are heavily corrupted by motion artifacts.
  The presence of these artifacts necessitates the creation of signal processing algorithms
  for removing the motion interference and allowing the true heart related information
  to be extracted from the PPG trace during exercise. Here, we describe a new publicly
  available database of PPG signals collected during exercise for the creation and
  validation of signal processing algorithms extracting heart rate and heart rate
  variability from PPG signals. PPG signals from the wrist are recorded together with
  chest electrocardiography (ECG) to allow a reference/comparison heart rate to be
  found, and the temporal alignment between the two signal sets is estimated from
  the signal timestamps. The new database differs from previously available public
  databases because it includes wrist PPG recorded during walking, running, easy bike
  riding and hard bike riding. It also provides estimates of the wrist movement recorded
  using a 3-axis low-noise accelerometer, a 3-axis wide-range accelerometer, and a
  3-axis gyroscope. The inclusion of gyroscopic information allows, for the first
  time, separation of acceleration due to gravity and acceleration due to true motion
  of the sensor. The hypothesis is that the improved motion information provided could
  assist in the development of algorithms with better PPG motion artifact removal
  performance.
