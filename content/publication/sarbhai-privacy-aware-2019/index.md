abstract: Smart meters record power consumption data at every minute or even every
  second. This fine-grained data on electricity usage exposes private information
  about the residents of the house like the number of occupants, times of occupancy,
  appliance information, and much more. A solution to obscure this data is to add
  a battery to each home and use it strategically to manipulate the readings observed
  at the smart meter. Deploying such a solution at a large scale can result in sudden
  peaks in the energy usage. This is an alarming concern for the electric utility
  companies as this may cause outages, making the grid unstable. This paper is the
  first to expose this shortcoming and propose algorithms to mitigate the problem
  while maintaining the privacy of the residents. Furthermore, this paper shows that
  the proposed algorithms are more effective in preserving privacy than existing ones
  while reducing the peak load.
