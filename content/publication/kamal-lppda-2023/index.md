abstract: Smart meters are continuously being deployed in several countries as a step
  in the direction of modernizing the power grid. Smart meters allow for automatic
  electricity consumption reporting to energy providers to facilitate billing and
  demand-based power generation. However, research has shown that such high resolution
  reporting to suppliers can potentially be used to invade consumers’ privacy; by
  identifying and predicting their behavior based on their consumption readings. This
  work presents a new protocol to preserve users’ privacy while maintaining the benefits
  of smart grids. The proposed method utilizes different techniques like randomization,
  masking, and differential privacy to build the scheme. The proposed method is shown
  to be more efficient compared to previous work in terms of performance and communication
  overhead. The implementation, simulation, and analysis are performed on datasets
  of real smart meters readings of households and electric vehicle chargers.
