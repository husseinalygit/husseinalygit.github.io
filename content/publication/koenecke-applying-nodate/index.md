abstract: For any ﬁnancial organization, forecasting economic and ﬁnancial variables
  is a critical operation. As the granularity at which forecasts are needed increases,
  traditional statistical time series models may not scale well; on the other hand,
  it is easy to incorrectly overﬁt machine learning models. In this chapter, we will
  describe the basics of traditional time series analyses, discuss how neural networks
  work, show how to implement time series forecasting using neural networks, and ﬁnally
  present an example with real data from Microsoft. In particular, Microsoft successfully
  approached revenue forecasting using deep neural networks conjointly with curriculum
  learning, which achieved a higher level of precision than is possible with traditional
  techniques.
