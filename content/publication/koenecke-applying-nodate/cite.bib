 abstract = {For any ﬁnancial organization, forecasting economic and ﬁnancial variables is a critical operation. As the granularity at which forecasts are needed increases, traditional statistical time series models may not scale well; on the other hand, it is easy to incorrectly overﬁt machine learning models. In this chapter, we will describe the basics of traditional time series analyses, discuss how neural networks work, show how to implement time series forecasting using neural networks, and ﬁnally present an example with real data from Microsoft. In particular, Microsoft successfully approached revenue forecasting using deep neural networks conjointly with curriculum learning, which achieved a higher level of precision than is possible with traditional techniques.},
