abstract: The most basic feature of every smart device or endpoint device in IoT is
  to collect the large amount of data that is being generated and direct it to a destination
  server via the Internet. IoT network is vulnerable to attacks and identification
  of these malicious behaviours at an early stage can save the data from attacks.
  The main objective of this work is to build machine learning models to identify
  attacks in IoT network. To build a model, normal and attack data needs to be generated
  from the IoT environment. A test bed is build to simulate the IoT environment using
  Node MCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor and wireless router. An adversarial system is build
  using a laptop system which performs actions of sniffing and poisoning attacks.
  Data captured from the sensors were temperature, humidity and due-point which are
  transmitted to ThinkSpeak platform using wireless gateway. In the normal phase,
  sensor values is captured by Node MCU and transmitted to Think Speak server which
  are stored and labelled as normal data. In the attacking phase, from an adversarial
  system, the attacker secretly intercepts the data, modifies the data when it is
  transmitted between the Node MCU and Think Speak server. In the attacking phase,
  Man in the Middle attack is performed in the network using ARP Poisoning and the
  data captured is labelled as attack data. Machine learning classifiers such as Na√Øve
  Bayes, SVM, decision tree, Adaboost are built to categorize data into normal and
  attack classes.
