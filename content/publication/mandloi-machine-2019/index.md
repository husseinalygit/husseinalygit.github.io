abstract: This study focuses on the application of machine learning and neural networks
  for the action selection and better understanding of the environment for controlling
  unmanned aerial vehicles, instead of explicit models to achieve the same task. Implementation
  of machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as non-linear regression were
  combined with neural networks to learn the system dynamics of a drone for the prediction
  of future states. Behavior cloning method is applied to mimic the actions of autopilot
  and comparative study of the decisions of autopilot and learned model were conducted
  in a simulated environment. The deep convolutional neural network was utilized for
  the visual perception task in the forest environment by detecting trees as obstacles.
  The prediction of future states and mimicking the autopilot actions were realized
  with relatively small error to the data from explicit model and the tree detection
  was successful even in the low sunlight condition.
