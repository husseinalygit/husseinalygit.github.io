abstract: Blood glucose level needs to be monitored regularly to manage the health
  condition of hyperglycemic patients. The current glucose measurement approaches
  still rely on invasive techniques which are uncomfortable and raise the risk of
  infection. To facilitate daily care at home, in this article, we propose an intelligent,
  noninvasive blood glucose monitoring system which can differentiate a user's blood
  glucose level into normal, borderline, and warning based on smartphone photoplethysmography
  (PPG) signals. The main implementation processes of the proposed system include
  1) a novel algorithm for acquiring PPG signals using only smartphone camera videos;
  2) a fitting-based sliding window algorithm to remove varying degrees of baseline
  drifts and segment the signal into single periods; 3) extracting characteristic
  features from the Gaussian functions by comparing PPG signals at different blood
  glucose levels; 4) categorizing the valid samples into three glucose levels by applying
  machine learning algorithms. Our proposed system was evaluated on a data set of
  80 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can separate valid
  signals from invalid ones at an accuracy of 97.54% and the overall accuracy of estimating
  the blood glucose levels reaches 81.49%. The proposed system provides a reference
  for the introduction of noninvasive blood glucose technology into daily or clinical
  applications. This article also indicates that smartphone-based PPG signals have
  great potential to assess an individual's blood glucose level.
