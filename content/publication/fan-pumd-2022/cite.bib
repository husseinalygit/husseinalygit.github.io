 abstract = {Domain name system (DNS), as one of the most critical internet infrastructure, has been abused by various cyber attacks. Current malicious domain detection capabilities are limited by insufficient credible label information, severe class imbalance, and incompact distribution of domain samples in different malicious activities. This paper proposes a malicious domain detection framework named PUMD, which innovatively introduces Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning solution to solve the problem of insufficient label information, adopts customized sample weight to improve the impact of class imbalance, and effectively constructs evidence features based on resource overlapping to reduce the intra-class distance of malicious samples. Besides, a feature selection strategy based on permutation importance and binning is proposed to screen the most informative detection features. Finally, we conduct experiments on the open source real DNS traffic dataset provided by QI-ANXIN Technology Group to evaluate the PUMD frameworkâ€™s ability to capture potential command and control (C&C) domains for malicious activities. The experimental results prove that PUMD can achieve the best detection performance under different label frequencies and class imbalance ratios.},
