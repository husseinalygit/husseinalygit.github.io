abstract: Domain name system (DNS), as one of the most critical internet infrastructure,
  has been abused by various cyber attacks. Current malicious domain detection capabilities
  are limited by insufficient credible label information, severe class imbalance,
  and incompact distribution of domain samples in different malicious activities.
  This paper proposes a malicious domain detection framework named PUMD, which innovatively
  introduces Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning solution to solve the problem of
  insufficient label information, adopts customized sample weight to improve the impact
  of class imbalance, and effectively constructs evidence features based on resource
  overlapping to reduce the intra-class distance of malicious samples. Besides, a
  feature selection strategy based on permutation importance and binning is proposed
  to screen the most informative detection features. Finally, we conduct experiments
  on the open source real DNS traffic dataset provided by QI-ANXIN Technology Group
  to evaluate the PUMD frameworkâ€™s ability to capture potential command and control
  (C&C) domains for malicious activities. The experimental results prove that PUMD
  can achieve the best detection performance under different label frequencies and
  class imbalance ratios.
