abstract: Over the last decade, smart cities (SC) have been developed worldwide. Implementing
  big data and the internet of things improves the monitoring and integration of different
  infrastructure systems in SC and thus makes our cities more efficient, livable,
  and sustainable. However, big data is more vulnerable to attacks and hacking, posing
  significant challenges to the SC's privacy and security. Moreover, more regulations
  and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with
  centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) provides a natural method
  to protect users' privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers
  artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers
  have recently implemented FL, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security
  of integrated systems in SC. However, many technological problems and risks have
  been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of FL's application
  to improve privacy and security in SC systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare,
  communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions
  of the implementation of FL in SC are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded
  that the existing FL systems required comprehensive testing for different types
  of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in SC.
