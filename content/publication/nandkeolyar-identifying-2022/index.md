abstract: Due to a surge in the usage of Electric Vehicles (EV), the burden on the
  power grid utilities have increased in the recent past. But the time-shiftable nature
  of the charging process of these EVs allow them to participate in Demand Response
  Programs (DRP) which offers a whole new dimension of flexibility in a Power system.
  In order to identify the availability of EV in a household, the grid operator can
  employ the concerned household's consumption data that is available through the
  smart meter installed there. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approach similar
  to Machine Learning has been proposed in this paper for identifying houses with
  EV. For operational purpose, this algorithm helps in desegregation of EV charging
  from smart meter's energy consumption data along with the determination of their
  charging/discharging state, and SOC estimation. This has been done in a non-intrusive
  way and is aimed towards the identification of time-flexible or shiftable loads
  for Demand Response (DR) participation. Data from the smart meters of over 1000
  households have been taken into account at different sampling frequencies. Several
  of these households have also incorporated roof top PV to make them self-reliant.
  The practicality of the proposed approach is ascertained by the simulation results
  that are based on real-world situations. An error analysis has been performed to
  observe the effectiveness of this method. The scope of participation for the identified
  EVs in DR programs has been discussed in the end.
