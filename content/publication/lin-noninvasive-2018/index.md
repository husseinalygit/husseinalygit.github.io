abstract: 'Diabetes has become a chronic metabolic disorder, and the growing diabetes
  population makes medical care more important. We investigated using a portable and
  noninvasive contact lens as an ideal sensor for diabetes patients whose tear fluid
  contains glucose. The key feature is the reversible covalent interaction between
  boronic acid and glucose, which can provide a noninvasive glucose sensor for diabetes
  patients. We present a phenylboronic acid (PBA)-based HEMA contact lens that exhibits
  a reversible swelling/shrinking effect to change its thickness. The difference in
  thickness can be detected in a picture taken with a smartphone and analyzed using
  software. Our novel technique offers the following capabilities: (i) non-enzymatic
  and continuous glucose detection with the contact lens; (ii) no need for an embedded
  circuit and power source for the glucose sensor; and (iii) the use of a smartphone
  to detect the change in thickness of the contact lens with no need for additional
  photo-sensors. This technique is promising for a noninvasive measurement of the
  glucose level and simple implementation of glucose sensing with a smartphone.'
