abstract: Automated detection of EVs from smart meter data can provide important insights
  for DSOs about spatiotemporal EV charging patterns. However, smart meters typically
  provide only hourly measurements of consumption while most load disaggregation techniques
  require at least minute level data. We use machine and deep learning methods to
  detect EV signatures in hourly smart meter data. Models are trained and evaluated
  on labelled data, before being tested on unlabelled field data. While balanced models
  catch about 75% of EVs at false positive rates of 35%, tuned models detect up to
  90% of EVs with 10% false positives. When using models to detect EVs on unlabelled
  Norwegian smart meter data, detections are in line with EV fractions from the national
  registry as well as expected spatiotemporal patterns. However, models may be confused
  by baseline consumption patterns. Collection and inclusion of labelled EVs is therefore
  the next step.
