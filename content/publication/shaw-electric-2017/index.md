abstract: With the more increase in population which is leading to rapid fossil fuel
  depletion and adding more pollution into environment, there will be more demand
  of Electric Vehicle in the future and with the more EV's going to come on road having
  old power distribution infrastructure it will bring charging problem of EV. Home
  charging of EV will bring overloading of transformer thus producing adverse effect
  on smart grid. In such conditions monitoring of EV charging plays a vital role in
  EV charge Scheduling and to monitor the power loading pattern of different houses
  under a transformer while EV charging by monitoring the smart meter. In this paper
  by Non-Intrusive load monitoring (NILM) an algorithm is developed that will disaggregate
  EV charging load and kWh consumed by EV from the aggregated power signal (real power
  in watts) of many appliances. This algorithm can also identify EV in presence of
  other high wattage appliances. Advantage of this algorithm is that it even works
  with low sampling rate of per second data (1/60 Hz) and can be easily trained with
  the area specific EV charging known database thus giving high estimation accuracy.
  This algorithm is checked on a monthly data of a house giving accuracy of more than
  90 percentage with the output information of how much kWh energy has been consumed
  by EV and the mean square error only 0.05 in disaggregating EV charging load.
