abstract: 'Diabetes is one of todayâ€™s greatest global problems, and it is only becoming
  bigger. Constant measuring of blood glucose level is a prerequisite for monitoring
  glucose blood level and establishing diabetes treatment procedures. The usual way
  of glucose level measuring is by an invasive procedure that requires finger pricking
  with the lancet and might become painful and obeying, especially if this becomes
  a daily routine. In this study, we analyze noninvasive glucose measurement approaches
  and present several classification dimensions according to different criteria: size,
  invasiveness, analyzed media, sensing properties, applied method, activation type,
  response delay, measurement duration, and access to results. We set the focus on
  using machine learning and neural network methods and correlation with heart rate
  variability and electrocardiogram, as a new research and development trend.'
