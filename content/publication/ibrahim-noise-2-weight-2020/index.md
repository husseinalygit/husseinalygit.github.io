abstract: 'The increasing popularity of autonomous and remotely-piloted drones have
  paved the way for several use-cases, e.g., merchandise delivery and surveillance.
  In many scenarios, estimating with zero-touch the weight of the payload carried
  by a drone before its physical approach could be attractive, e.g., to provide an
  early tampering detection. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to remotely
  detect the weight of the payload carried by a commercial drone by analyzing its
  acoustic fingerprint. We characterize the difference in the thrust needed by the
  drone to carry different payloads, resulting in significant variations of the related
  acoustic fingerprint. We applied the above findings to different use-cases, characterized
  by different computational capabilities of the detection system. Results are striking:
  using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) components of the audio signal
  and different Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, we achieved a minimum classification
  accuracy of 98% in the detection of the specific payload class carried by the drone,
  using an acquisition time of 0.25 s---performances improve when using longer time
  acquisitions. All the data used for our analysis have been released as open-source,
  to enable the community to validate our findings and use such data as a ready-to-use
  basis for further investigations.'
