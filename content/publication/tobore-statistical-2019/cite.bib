 abstract = {Globally, the cases of diabetes mellitus (diabetes) have increased in the past three decades, and it is recorded as one of the leading cause of death. This epidemic is a metabolic condition where the body cannot regulate blood glucose, thereby leading to abnormally high blood sugar. Genetic condition plays a significant role to determine a person susceptibility to the condition, a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet are behaviour that supports the current global epidemic. The complication that arises from diabetes includes loss of vision, peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular complications and so on. Victims of this condition require constant monitoring of blood glucose which is done by the pricking of the finger. This procedure is painful, inconvenient and can lead to disease infection. Therefore, it is important to find a way to measure blood glucose non-invasively to minimize or eliminate the disadvantages encountered with the usual monitoring of blood glucose.},
