abstract: Electric utility companies are interested in load profile (electricity consumption)
  data when it comes to expansion planning. With the evolution of the smart grid and
  distributed energy resource concepts, the requirement of load profile data for planning
  has become critical. Conventional methods of collecting the load profile data, such
  as surveys and metering, are very tedious and time consuming activities. Consumer
  demand, as well as continuous technological evolution, contribute to rendering data
  obsolete in a short period of time. Furthermore, cumbersome data collection processes
  also pose barriers. In this paper, we present an innovative behavior model for generating
  electricity consumption load profiles. Our model requires minimum consumer data
  and can be easily updated to adapt to the changing technology. We demonstrate the
  accuracy of our model against real world data.
