abstract: Mobile applications have become widely popular for their ability to access
  real-time information. In electric vehicle (EV) mobility, these applications are
  used by drivers to locate charging stations in public spaces, pay for charging transactions,
  and engage with other users. This activity generates a rich source of data about
  charging infrastructure and behavior. However, an increasing share of this data
  is stored as unstructured textâ€”inhibiting our ability to interpret behavior in real-time.
  In this article, we implement recent transformer-based deep learning algorithms,
  BERT and XLnet, that have been tailored to automatically classify short user reviews
  about EV charging experiences. We achieve classification results with a mean accuracy
  of over 91% and a mean F1 score of over 0.81 allowing for more precise detection
  of topic categories, even in the presence of highly imbalanced data. Using these
  classification algorithms as a pre-processing step, we analyze a U.S. national dataset
  with econometric methods to discover the dominant topics of discourse in charging
  infrastructure. After adjusting for station characteristics and other factors, we
  find that the functionality of a charging station is the dominant topic among EV
  drivers and is more likely to be discussed at points-of-interest with negative user
  experiences.
