abstract: Noise can compromise the extraction of some fundamental and important features
  from biomedical signals and hence prohibit accurate analysis of these signals. Baseline
  wander in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is one such example, which can be caused
  by factors such as respiration, variations in electrode impedance, and excessive
  body movements. Unless baseline wander is effectively removed, the accuracy of any
  feature extracted from the ECG, such as timing and duration of the ST-segment, is
  compromised. This paper approaches this filtering task from a novel standpoint by
  assuming that the ECG baseline wander comes from an independent and unknown source.
  The technique utilizes a hierarchical method including a blind source separation
  (BSS) step, in particular independent component analysis, to eliminate the effect
  of the baseline wander. We examine the specifics of the components causing the baseline
  wander and the factors that affect the separation process. Experimental results
  reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in removing the baseline wander.
