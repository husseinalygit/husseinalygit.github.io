abstract: Cryptojacking is the process of utilizing one's systems resources without
  their knowledge to mine cryptocurrency. This can be done by injecting a malicious
  javascript code into the website. The malicious javascript code injected utilizes
  system's resources in order to compute hashes.Most of the classic cryptocurrencies
  such as bitcoin, monero, webchain are built on proof-of-work(pow) algorithm called
  CryptoNight, which is CPU-bound. They make use of memorybound functions for constructing
  computational puzzles [1], in order to maximize profit. This total process requires
  a lot of disc read and write operations. Hence, we have monitored the cache activity
  to detect whether cryptojacking exists or not. In addition to detection, our method
  can also detect the CPU percentage throttle set by the attacker making it a multiclass
  classification problem. We have leveraged a tool called `perf' [2] in order to measure
  the number of cache hits and misses. Using this methodology, we were able to detect
  cryptojacking corresponding to each class with an accuracy of 96.25%.
