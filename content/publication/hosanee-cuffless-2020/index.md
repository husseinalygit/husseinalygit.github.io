abstract: One in three adults worldwide has hypertension, which is associated with
  significant morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is a global demand for
  continuous and non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements that are convenient,
  easy to use, and more accurate than the currently available methods for detecting
  hypertension. This could easily be achieved through the integration of single-site
  photoplethysmography (PPG) readings into wearable devices, although improved reliability
  and an understanding of BP estimation accuracy are essential. This review paper
  focuses on understanding the features of PPG associated with BP and examines the
  development of this technology over the 2010&ndash;2019 period in terms of validation,
  sample size, diversity of subjects, and datasets used. Challenges and opportunities
  to move single-site PPG forward are also discussed.
