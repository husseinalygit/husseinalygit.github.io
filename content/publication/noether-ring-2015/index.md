abstract: This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly
  decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency
  which is distributed through a proof of work ``mining'' process. The original Monero
  protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to
  hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using
  a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented
  by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature,
  A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which
  allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable
  efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note
  that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin
  research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in iÌ§teSnoe.
