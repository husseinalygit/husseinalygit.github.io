abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science
  that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient
  for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves
  various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional
  neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and
  functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such
  intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging,
  and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)
  emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical
  devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review,
  we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care
  (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer
  diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic
  surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this
  article. The position and importance of AI in improving the functionality, detection
  accuracy, decision-making ability of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated
  risks assessment is discussed carefully and critically in this review. This review
  also encompasses the technological and engineering challenges and prospects for
  AI-based cloud-integrated personalized IoMT devices for designing efficient POC
  biomedical systems suitable for next-generation intelligent healthcare.
