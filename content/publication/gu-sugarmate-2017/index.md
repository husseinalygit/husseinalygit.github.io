abstract: Inferring abnormal glucose events such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
  is crucial for the health of both diabetic patients and non-diabetic people. However,
  regular blood glucose monitoring can be invasive and inconvenient in everyday life.
  We present SugarMate, a first smartphone-based blood glucose inference system as
  a temporary alternative to continuous blood glucose monitors (CGM) when they are
  uncomfortable or inconvenient to wear. In addition to the records of food, drug
  and insulin intake, it leverages smartphone sensors to measure physical activities
  and sleep quality automatically. Provided with the imbalanced and often limited
  measurements, a challenge of SugarMate is the inference of blood glucose levels
  at a fine-grained time resolution. We propose Md3RNN, an efficient learning paradigm
  to make full use of the available blood glucose information. Specifically, the newly
  designed grouped input layers, together with the adoption of a deep RNN model, offer
  an opportunity to build blood glucose models for the general public based on limited
  personal measurements from single-user and grouped-users perspectives. Evaluations
  on 112 users demonstrate that Md3RNN yields an average accuracy of 82.14%, significantly
  outperforming previous learning methods those are either shallow, generically structured,
  or oblivious to grouped behaviors. Also, a user study with the 112 participants
  shows that SugarMate is acceptable for practical usage.
