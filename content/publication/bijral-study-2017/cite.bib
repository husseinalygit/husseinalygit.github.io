 abstract = {As the organizational dependency on information exchange has increased exponentially the threats to information security have also increased. The organization has to spend a generous amount of resources to protect the information from the intruders. Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of the network applications to have unauthorized access to organizational information. These vulnerabilities come into being because of poor application code or design. In this paper we will be discussing one such type of design level vulnerability that is ARP Spoofing. ARP Spoofing has been used to perform many types of attacks, including session hijacking, and cookie hijacking. We have used Snort for detecting ARP Spoofing. Performance of the snort for detecting ARP Spoofing has been studied experimentally on a real network by varying number of the target.},
