 abstract = {Current glucose monitoring methods for the ever-increasing number of diabetic people around the world are invasive, painful, time-consuming, and a constant burden for the household budget. The non-invasive glucose monitoring technology overcomes these limitations, for which this topic is significantly being researched and represents an exciting and highly sought after market for many companies. This review aims to offer an up-to-date report on the leading technologies for non-invasive (NI) and minimally-invasive (MI) glucose monitoring sensors, devices currently available in the market, regulatory framework for accuracy assessment, new approaches currently under study by representative groups and developers, and algorithm types for signal enhancement and value prediction. The review also discusses the future trend of glucose detection by analyzing the usage of the different bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. The review concludes that the adoption and use of new technologies for glucose detection is unavoidable and closer to become a reality.},
