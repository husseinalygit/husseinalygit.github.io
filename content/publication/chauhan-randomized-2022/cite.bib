 abstract = {Multilabel classification is a supervised learning problem in which input instances belong to multiple output labels. In this paper, we propose noniterative randomization-based neural networks for multilabel classification. These multilabel neural networks are named as Multilabel Random Vector Functional Link Network (ML-RVFL), Multilabel Kernelized Random Vector Functional Link Network (ML-KRVFL), Multilabel Broad Learning System (ML-BLS), and Multilabel Fuzzy Broad Learning System (ML-FBLS). The output weights of these neural networks are computed using pseudoinverse. At the output layer, multilabel classification is performed by using an adaptive threshold function. The computation of output weights using pseudoinverse retains the faster computation power of these algorithms compared to iterative learning algorithms. The adaptive threshold function used in the proposed approach can consider the correlation among the output labels and the whole dataset for threshold computation. Five multilabel evaluation metrics evaluate the proposed multilabel neural networks on 12 benchmark datasets of various domains such as text, image, and genomics. The ML-KRVFL provides the overall best Friedman rankings on five evaluation metrics followed by ML-RVFL, ML-FBLS, and ML-BLS, respectively. Based on the experimentation results, the proposed ML-KRVFL, ML-RVFL, ML-FBLS, and ML-BLS perform better than other relevant multilabel approaches in the mentioned order.The proposed approaches are faster than other state-of-the-art iterative approaches and noniterative approaches in terms of running time.},
