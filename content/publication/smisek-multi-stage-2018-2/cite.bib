 abstract = {Objective: Use of wearable ECG devices for arrhythmia screening is 
limited due to poor signal quality, small number of leads and short
records, leading to incorrect recognition of pathological events. This
paper introduces a novel approach to classification
(normal/‘N’, atrial fibrillation/‘A’,
other/‘O’, and noisy/‘P’) of short single-lead
ECGs recorded by wearable devices. Approach: Various rhythm and
morphology features are derived from the separate beats
(‘local’ features) as well as the entire ECGs
(‘global’ features) to represent short-term events and
general trends respectively. Various types of atrial and ventricular
activity, heart beats and, finally, ECG records are then recognised by a
multi-level approach combining a support vector machine (SVM), decision
tree and threshold-based rules. Main results: The proposed features are
suitable for the recognition of ‘A’. The method is robust
due to the noise estimation involved. A combination of radial and linear
SVMs ensures both high predictive performance and effective
generalisation. Cost-sensitive learning, genetic algorithm feature
selection and thresholding improve overall performance. The
generalisation ability and reliability of this approach are high, as
verified by cross-validation on a training set and by blind testing,
with only a slight decrease of overall F1-measure, from 0.84 on training
to 0.81 on the tested dataset. ‘O’ recognition seems to be
the most difficult (test F1-measures: 0.90/‘N’,
0.81/‘A’ and 0.72/‘O’) due to high inter-patient
variability and similarity with ‘N’. Significance: These
study results contribute to multidisciplinary areas, focusing on
creation of robust and reliable cardiac monitoring systems in order to
improve diagnosis, reduce unnecessary time-consuming expert ECG scoring
and, consequently, ensure timely and effective treatment.},
