 abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is sensitive to autonomic dysfunction and cardiac complications derived from ischemic or hemorrhage stroke and is supposed to be a potential prognostic tool in stroke identification and post-stroke treatment. ECG data generated cannot be real-time accumulated, processed, and used for enterprise-level healthcare and wellness services with the existing cardiovascular monitoring system used in hospitals. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a cyber-physical cardiac monitoring system to classify stroke patients with altered cardiac activity and healthy adults. Here, we propose Big-ECG, a cyber-physical cardiac monitoring system for stroke management, consisting of a wearable ECG sensor, data storage and data analysis in a big data platform, and health advisory services using data analytics and medical ontology. We investigated our proposed ECG-based patient monitoring system with 45 stroke patients (average age 70.8 years old, 68% men) admitted to the rehabilitation center of the hospital and 40 healthy elderly volunteers (average age 75.4 years old, 38% men). We recorded ECG at resting state using a single-channel ECG patch within three months of diagnosis of ischemic stroke (clinically confirmed). In statistical results, ECG fiducial features, RR-I, QRS, QT, ST, and heart rate variability (HRV) features, SDSD, LF/HF, LF/(LF + HF), and HF/(LF + HF) are observed as significantly distinctive biomarkers for the stroke group relative to the healthy control group. The Random Trees model presented the best classification performance (overall accuracy: 95.6%) utilizing ECG fiducial variables. This system may assist healthcare enterprises in prognosis and rehabilitation management during post-stroke treatment.},
