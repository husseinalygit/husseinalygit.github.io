abstract: The increasing coverage of Internet has created opportunities and advantages
  for different aspects of society. However, there come new threats and challenges
  to information security. One of the typical types of attacks that has increasingly
  occurred is the APT attack (Advanced Persistent Threat). APT is dangerous with clear
  purposes. APT attacks employ different sophisticated methods and techniques attacking
  targets in order to steal confidential and sensitive information. In the past, hackers
  attacked information systems with personal and financial motives. However, there
  are nowadays other motives such as political ones and they are potentially backed
  by governments or nations. Nations that own advanced technologies such as United
  States, India, Russia, UK are also suffering from special purpose attacks. APT is
  an advanced type of attacks that consists of many stages and concrete strategies.
  Besides, techniques and technologies employed in APT attack are usually new and
  developed by hackers in order to break through the monitoring of security software.
  However, APT is normally implemented through concrete steps and stages. If one of
  the steps or stages fails, the entire APT attack will fail. This paper presents
  a method of detecting APT attacks based on monitoring accesses to unknown domains.
  This detection method results into high effectiveness in the initial stage of APT
  attacks.
