abstract: 'Cooperation between different data owners may lead to an improvement in
  forecast quality—for instance, by benefiting from spatiotemporal dependencies in
  geographically distributed time series. Due to business competitive factors and
  personal data protection concerns, however, said data owners might be unwilling
  to share their data. Interest in collaborative privacy-preserving forecasting is
  thus increasing. This paper analyzes the state-of-the-art and unveils several shortcomings
  of existing methods in guaranteeing data privacy when employing vector autoregressive
  models. The methods are divided into three groups: data transformation, secure multi-party
  computations, and decomposition methods. The analysis shows that state-of-the-art
  techniques have limitations in preserving data privacy, such as (i) the necessary
  trade-off between privacy and forecasting accuracy, empirically evaluated through
  simulations and real-world experiments based on solar data; and (ii) iterative model
  fitting processes, which reveal data after a number of iterations.'
