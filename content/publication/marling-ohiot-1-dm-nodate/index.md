abstract: This paper documents the OhioT1DM Dataset, which was developed to promote
  and facilitate research in blood glucose level prediction. It contains eight weeksâ€™
  worth of continuous glucose monitoring, insulin, physiological sensor, and self-reported
  lifeevent data for each of 12 people with type 1 diabetes. An associated graphical
  software tool allows researchers to visualize the integrated data. The paper details
  the contents and format of the dataset and tells interested researchers how to obtain
  it.
