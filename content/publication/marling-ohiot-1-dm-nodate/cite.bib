 abstract = {This paper documents the OhioT1DM Dataset, which was developed to promote and facilitate research in blood glucose level prediction. It contains eight weeksâ€™ worth of continuous glucose monitoring, insulin, physiological sensor, and self-reported lifeevent data for each of 12 people with type 1 diabetes. An associated graphical software tool allows researchers to visualize the integrated data. The paper details the contents and format of the dataset and tells interested researchers how to obtain it.},
