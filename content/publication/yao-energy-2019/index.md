abstract: As a prominent early instance of the Internet of Things in the smart grid,
  the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides real-time information from smart
  meters to both grid operators and customers, exploiting the full potential of demand
  response. However, the newly collected information without security protection can
  be maliciously altered and result in huge loss. In this paper, we propose an energy
  theft detection scheme with energy privacy preservation in the smart grid. Especially,
  we use combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect abnormal behavior
  of the metering data from a long-period pattern observation. In addition, we employ
  Paillier algorithm to protect the energy privacy. In other words, the usersâ€™ energy
  data are securely protected in the transmission and the data disclosure is minimized.
  Our security analysis demonstrates that in our scheme data privacy and authentication
  are both achieved. Experimental results illustrate that our modified CNN model can
  effectively detect abnormal behaviors at an accuracy up to 92.67%.
