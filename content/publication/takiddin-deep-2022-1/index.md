abstract: Designing an electricity theft cyberattack detector for the advanced metering
  infrastructures (AMIs) is challenging due to the limited availability of electricity
  theft datasets (i.e., malicious datasets). Anomaly detectors, which are trained
  solely on honest customers’ energy consumption profiles (i.e., benign datasets),
  could potentially overcome this challenge. Unfortunately, existing anomaly detectors
  in AMIs present shallow architectures and are incapable of capturing the temporal
  correlations as well as the sophisticated patterns present in the electricity consumption
  data, which impact their detection performance negatively. This article proposes
  the adoption of deep (stacked) autoencoders with a long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based
  sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) structure. The depth of the autoencoders’ structure
  helps capture the sophisticated patterns of the data and the seq2seq LSTM model
  enables exploitation of the time-series nature of data. We investigate the performance
  of simple autoencoder, variational autoencoder, and autoencoder with attention (AEA),
  in which improved detection performance is observed when seq2seq structures are
  adopted compared to fully connected ones. Based on the simulation results, the AEA
  detector offers an enhancement of 4!-!21% and 4!-!13% in terms of detection rate
  and false alarm rate, respectively, compared to existing state-of-the-art detectors
