abstract: In order to accurately identify new energy electric vehicles charging behaviour
  characteristic parameter, the theory of consistency is put forward based on the
  k-means clustering method. The complex coupling network including consistency control
  is introduced into the data clustering analysis to accurately describe the consistency
  characteristics of the electric vehicles charging load data in different periods,
  and the dissimilarity measure with the state update of the adjacent cluster data
  is used to quickly calculate the initial cluster center. The k-means method is used
  to quickly identify the expected value of EV initial charging time in typical scenes,
  and to accurately extract the probability distribution function of EV charging probability
  and charging initial time. Combined with a practical case, it is verified that the
  proposed method has the advantages of simple calculation, fast clustering.
