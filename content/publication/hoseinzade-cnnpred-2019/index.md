abstract: Feature extraction from financial data is one of the most important problems
  in market prediction domain for which many approaches have been suggested. Among
  other modern tools, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been applied
  for automatic feature selection and market prediction. However, in experiments reported
  so far, less attention has been paid to the correlation among different markets
  as a possible source of information for extracting features. In this paper, we suggest
  a CNN-based framework, that can be applied on a collection of data from a variety
  of sources, including different markets, in order to extract features for predicting
  the future of those markets. The suggested framework has been applied for predicting
  the next day’s direction of movement for the indices of S&P 500, NASDAQ, DJI, NYSE,
  and RUSSELL based on various sets of initial variables. The evaluations show a significant
  improvement in prediction’s performance compared to the state of the art baseline
  algorithms.
