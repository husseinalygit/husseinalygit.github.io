 abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals collected from wearable devices are easily corrupted with surrounding noise and artefacts, where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of wearable ECG signals is significantly lower than that from hospital ECG machines. To meet the requirements for monitoring heart disease via wearable devices, eliminating useless or poor-quality ECG signals (e.g., lead-falls and low SNRs) can be solved by signal quality assessment algorithms.},
