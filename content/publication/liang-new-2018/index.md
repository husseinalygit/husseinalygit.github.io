abstract: Open clinical trial data provide a valuable opportunity for researchers
  worldwide to assess new hypotheses, validate published results, and collaborate
  for scientific advances in medical research. Here, we present a health dataset for
  the non-invasive detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD), containing 657 data
  segments from 219 subjects. The dataset covers an age range of 20â€“89 years and records
  of diseases including hypertension and diabetes. Data acquisition was carried out
  under the control of standard experimental conditions and specifications. This dataset
  can be used to carry out the study of photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal quality evaluation
  and to explore the intrinsic relationship between the PPG waveform and cardiovascular
  disease to discover and evaluate latent characteristic information contained in
  PPG signals. These data can also be used to study early and noninvasive screening
  of common CVD such as hypertension and other related CVD diseases such as diabetes.
