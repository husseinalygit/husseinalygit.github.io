abstract: "For both the acquisition of mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) devices and
  early warning and diagnosis of clinical work, high-quality ECG signals is particularly
  important. We describe an effective system which could be deployed as a stand-alone
  signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the quality of ECG signals. The
  proposed ECG quality assessment method is based on the simple heuristic fusion and
  fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the SQIs. This method includes two modules, i.e.,
  the quantification and extraction of Signal Quality Indexes (SQIs) for different
  features, intelligent assessment and classification. First, simple heuristic fusion
  is executed to extract SQIs and determine the following SQIs: R peak detection match
  qSQI, QRS wave power spectrum distribution pSQI, kurtosis kSQI, and baseline relative
  power basSQI. Then, combined with Cauchy distribution, rectangular distribution
  and trapezoidal distribution, the membership function of SQIs was quantified, and
  the fuzzy vector was established. The bounded operator was selected for fuzzy synthesis,
  and the weighted membership function was used to perform the assessment and classification.
  The performance of the proposed method was tested on the database from Physionet
  ECG database, with an accuracy (Acc) of 97.67%, sensitivity (Se) of 96.33% and specificity
  (Sp) of 98.33% on the training set. Testing against the test datasets resulted in
  scores of 94.67, 90.33, and 93.00%, respectively. There's no gold standard exists
  for determining the quality of ECGs. However, the proposed algorithm discriminates
  between high- and poor-quality ECGs, which could aid in ECG acquisition for mobile
  ECG devices, early clinical diagnosis and early warning."
