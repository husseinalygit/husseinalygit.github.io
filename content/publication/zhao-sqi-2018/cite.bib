 abstract = {For both the acquisition of mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) devices and early warning and diagnosis of clinical work, high-quality ECG signals is particularly important. We describe an effective system which could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the quality of ECG signals. The proposed ECG quality assessment method is based on the simple heuristic fusion and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the SQIs. This method includes two modules, i.e., the quantification and extraction of Signal Quality Indexes (SQIs) for different features, intelligent assessment and classification. First, simple heuristic fusion is executed to extract SQIs and determine the following SQIs: R peak detection match qSQI, QRS wave power spectrum distribution pSQI, kurtosis kSQI, and baseline relative power basSQI. Then, combined with Cauchy distribution, rectangular distribution and trapezoidal distribution, the membership function of SQIs was quantified, and the fuzzy vector was established. The bounded operator was selected for fuzzy synthesis, and the weighted membership function was used to perform the assessment and classification. The performance of the proposed method was tested on the database from Physionet ECG database, with an accuracy (Acc) of 97.67%, sensitivity (Se) of 96.33% and specificity (Sp) of 98.33% on the training set. Testing against the test datasets resulted in scores of 94.67, 90.33, and 93.00%, respectively. There's no gold standard exists for determining the quality of ECGs. However, the proposed algorithm discriminates between high- and poor-quality ECGs, which could aid in ECG acquisition for mobile ECG devices, early clinical diagnosis and early warning.},
