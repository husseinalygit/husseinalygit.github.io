abstract: A bionic hand with fine motor ability could be a favorable option for replacing
  the human hand when performing various operations. Myoelectric control has been
  widely used to recognize hand movements in recent years. However, most of the previous
  studies have focused on whole-hand movements, with only a few investigating subtler
  motions. The aim of this study was to construct a prototype system for recognizing
  hand postures with the aim of controlling a bionic hand by analyzing sEMG signals
  measured at the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles. We
  adopted multiple features commonly used in previous studies—mean absolute value,
  zero crossing, slope sign change, and waveform length—in the algorithm for extracting
  hand-posture features, and the k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm as the classifier
  to perform hand-posture recognition. The bionic hand was controlled by an Arduino
  microprocessor, which converted the signals received from the classification process
  that were fed to the servo motors controlling the bionic fingers. We constructed
  a two-channel sEMG pattern-recognition system that can identify human hand postures
  and control a homemade bionic hand to perform corresponding hand postures. The KNN
  approach was able to recognize four different hand postures with a classification
  accuracy of 94% in the online experiment by using the channel combination. Moreover,
  the experimental tests show that the bionic hand could faithfully imitate the hand
  postures of the human hand. This study has bridged the gap between the features
  of sEMG signals of fingers and the postures of a bionic hand.
