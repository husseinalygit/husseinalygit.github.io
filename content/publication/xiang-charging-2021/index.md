abstract: 'Extracting the charging load pattern of residential electric vehicle (REV)
  will help grid operators make informed decisions in terms of scheduling and demand-side
  response management. Due to the multistate and high-frequency characteristics of
  integrated residential appliances from the residential perspective, it is difficult
  to achieve accurate extraction of the charging load pattern. To deal with that,
  this article presents a novel charging load extraction method based on residential
  smart meter data to noninvasively extract REV charging load pattern. The proposed
  algorithm harnesses the low-frequency characteristics of the charging load pattern
  and applies a two-stage decomposition technique to extract the characteristics of
  the charging load. The two-stage decomposition technique mainly includes: the trend
  component of the charging load being decomposed by seasonal and trend decomposition
  using loess method, and the low-frequency approximate component being decomposed
  by discrete wavelet technology. Furthermore, based on the extracted characteristics,
  event monitoring, and dynamic time warping is applied to estimate the closest charging
  interval and amplitude. The key features of the proposed algorithm include 1) significant
  improvement in extraction accuracy; 2) strong noise immunity; 3) online implementation
  of extraction. Experiments based on ground truth data validate the superiority of
  the proposed method compared to the existing ones.'
