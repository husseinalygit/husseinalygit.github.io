abstract: Diabetic patients are dependent on external substances to balance their
  blood glucose level. In order to control this level, they historically needed to
  sample a drop a blood from their hand and have it analyzed. Recently, other directions
  emerged to offer alternative ways to estimate glucose level. In this paper, we present
  our ongoing work on a framework for inferring semantically annotated glycemic events
  on the patient, which leverages mobile wearable sensors on a sport-belt.
