 abstract = {Diabetic patients are dependent on external substances to balance their blood glucose level. In order to control this level, they historically needed to sample a drop a blood from their hand and have it analyzed. Recently, other directions emerged to offer alternative ways to estimate glucose level. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on a framework for inferring semantically annotated glycemic events on the patient, which leverages mobile wearable sensors on a sport-belt.},
