abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in smart buildings are becoming increasingly
  ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable. These
  devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount
  importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage
  in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is
  often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate
  the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the
  multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously
  while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose
  a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time
  memory (LSTM) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during
  training convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our
  federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated
  by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving
  state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification
  and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising
  the prediction performance.
