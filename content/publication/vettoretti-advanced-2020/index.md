abstract: Wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors are revolutionizing
  the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). These sensors provide in real-time, every
  1&ndash;5 min, the current blood glucose concentration and its rate-of-change, two
  key pieces of information for improving the determination of exogenous insulin administration
  and the prediction of forthcoming adverse events, such as hypo-/hyper-glycemia.
  The current research in diabetes technology is putting considerable effort into
  developing decision support systems for patient use, which automatically analyze
  the patient&rsquo;s data collected by CGM sensors and other portable devices, as
  well as providing personalized recommendations about therapy adjustments to patients.
  Due to the large amount of data collected by patients with T1D and their variety,
  artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being adopted in these
  decision support systems. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methodologies
  using AI and CGM sensors for decision support in advanced T1D management, including
  techniques for personalized insulin bolus calculation, adaptive tuning of bolus
  calculator parameters and glucose prediction.
