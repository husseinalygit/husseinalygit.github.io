 title = {Diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, however patients with diabetes may also develop hypoglycemia due to treatment. There is an increasing demand for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and trends detection amongst people with diabetes and healthy individuals, especially athletes. Wearable devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic, bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection. We also review methods that use machine learning algorithms to predict blood glucose trends, especially for high risk events such as hypoglycemia. Convolutional and recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees are examples of such machine learning algorithms. Finally, we address the key limitations and challenges of these studies and provide recommendations for future work.},
