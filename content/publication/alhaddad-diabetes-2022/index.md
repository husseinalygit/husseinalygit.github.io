title: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, however
  patients with diabetes may also develop hypoglycemia due to treatment. There is
  an increasing demand for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring and trends detection
  amongst people with diabetes and healthy individuals, especially athletes. Wearable
  devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable
  advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing
  technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic,
  bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily
  fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection. We also review methods
  that use machine learning algorithms to predict blood glucose trends, especially
  for high risk events such as hypoglycemia. Convolutional and recurrent neural networks,
  support vector machines, and decision trees are examples of such machine learning
  algorithms. Finally, we address the key limitations and challenges of these studies
  and provide recommendations for future work.
