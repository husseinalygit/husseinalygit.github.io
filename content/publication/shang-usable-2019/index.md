abstract: Smartwatches are expected to become the world's best-selling electronic
  product after smartphones. Various smart-watches have been released to the private
  consumer market, but the data on smartwatches is not well protected. In this paper,
  we show for the first time that photoplethysmography (PPG)signals influenced by
  hand gestures can be used to authenticate users on smartwatches. The insight is
  that muscle and tendon movements caused by hand gestures compress the arterial geometry
  with different degrees, which has a significant impact on the blood flow. Based
  on this insight, novel approaches are proposed to detect the starting point and
  ending point of the hand gesture from raw PPG signals and determine if these PPG
  signals are from a normal user or an attacker. Different from existing solutions,
  our approach leverages the PPG sensors that are available on most smartwatches and
  does not need to collect training data from attackers. Also, our system can be used
  in more general scenarios wherever users can perform hand gestures and is robust
  against shoulder surfing attacks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the
  performance of our system and show that our system achieves an average authentication
  accuracy of 96.31 % and an average true rejection rate of at least 91.64% against
  two types of attacks.
