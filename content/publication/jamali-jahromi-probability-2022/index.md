abstract: Residential electric vehicle (REV) is an advanced technology with a rapid
  growth rate in transportation and electric grids. One key challenge in the operation
  of REVs is the necessity of the accurate, reliable, and practical forecasting method
  to provide accurate information of the charging profile in the look-ahead hours.
  In power system, in order to optimize the production and consumption as much as
  possible, in addition to accurately predicting the amount of electricity consumption,
  it is necessary for the stability of the grid to take into account the imminent
  probabilities. This paper presents the main principle of the probability density
  function forecasting approach in residential electric vehicle (REV) charging profile.
  To this end, an end-to-end deep learning structure is designed and integrated with
  kernel density estimation (KDE). The designed network is composed of four major
  blocks, i.e., convolutional layers to extract full spatial features, gated recurrent
  unit (GRU) to fully understand the temporal features as a time-efficient version
  of the gated deep network, an autoregressive (AR) to model the long patterns including
  battery type, REV type, and number of REVs and kernel density estimator block. Furthermore,
  to improve the learning ability of the designed network, an attention mechanism
  is integrated into the design network. The numerical results on the actual REVs
  (about 348 REVs) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed network
  through several cases and comparison with several well-known deep and shallow-based
  methods.
