abstract: Hypoglycemia is a very common in type 1 diabetic persons and can occur at
  any age. It is always threatening to the well-being of patients with Type 1 diabetes
  mellitus (T1DM) since hypoglycemia leads to seizures or loss of consciousness and
  the possible development of permanent brain dysfunction under certain circumstances.
  Because of that, an accurate continuing hypoglycemia monitoring system is a very
  important medical device for diabetic patients. In this paper, we proposed a non-invasive
  hypoglycemia monitoring system using the physiological parameters of electrocardiography
  (ECG) signal. To enhance the detection accuracy, extreme learning machine (ELM)
  is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemia. A clinical study of 16 children
  with T1DM is given to illustrate the good performance of ELM.
