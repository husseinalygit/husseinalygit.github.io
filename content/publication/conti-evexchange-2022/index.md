abstract: To support the increasing spread of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Charging Stations
  (CSs) are being installed worldwide. The new generation of CSs employs the Vehicle-To-Grid
  (V2G) paradigm by implementing novel standards such as the ISO 15118. This standard
  enables high-level communication between the vehicle and the charging column, helps
  manage the charge smartly, and simplifies the payment phase. This novel charging
  paradigm, which connects the Smart Grid to external networks (e.g., EVs and CSs),
  has not been thoroughly examined yet. Therefore, it may lead to dangerous vulnerability
  surfaces and new research challenges.
