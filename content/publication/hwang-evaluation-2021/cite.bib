 abstract = {In this work, we demonstrates the feasibility of employing the biometric photoplethysmography (PPG) signal for human verification applications. The PPG signal has dominance in terms of accessibility and portability which makes its usage in many applications such as user access control very appealing. Therefore, we developed robust time-stable features using signal analysis and deep learning models to increase the robustness and performance of the verification system with the PPG signal. The proposed system focuses on utilizing different stretching mechanisms namely Dynamic Time Warping, zero padding and interpolation with Fourier transform, and fuses them at the data level to be then deployed with different deep learning models. The designed deep models consist of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) which are considered to build a user specific model for the verification task. We collected a dataset consisting of 100 participants and recorded at two different time sessions using Plux pulse sensor. This dataset along with another two public databases are deployed to evaluate the performance of the proposed verification system in terms of uniqueness and time stability. The final result demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system tested on the built dataset and compared with other two public databases. The best performance achieved from our collected two-sessions database in terms of accuracy is 98% for the single-session and 87.1% for the two-sessions scenarios.},
