abstract: In this work, we demonstrates the feasibility of employing the biometric
  photoplethysmography (PPG) signal for human verification applications. The PPG signal
  has dominance in terms of accessibility and portability which makes its usage in
  many applications such as user access control very appealing. Therefore, we developed
  robust time-stable features using signal analysis and deep learning models to increase
  the robustness and performance of the verification system with the PPG signal. The
  proposed system focuses on utilizing different stretching mechanisms namely Dynamic
  Time Warping, zero padding and interpolation with Fourier transform, and fuses them
  at the data level to be then deployed with different deep learning models. The designed
  deep models consist of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory
  (LSTM) which are considered to build a user specific model for the verification
  task. We collected a dataset consisting of 100 participants and recorded at two
  different time sessions using Plux pulse sensor. This dataset along with another
  two public databases are deployed to evaluate the performance of the proposed verification
  system in terms of uniqueness and time stability. The final result demonstrates
  the superiority of our proposed system tested on the built dataset and compared
  with other two public databases. The best performance achieved from our collected
  two-sessions database in terms of accuracy is 98% for the single-session and 87.1%
  for the two-sessions scenarios.
