abstract: '(1) Background: nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH) is one of the most challenging
  side effects of multiple doses of insulin (MDI) therapy in type 1 diabetes (T1D).
  This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of a machine-learning-based prediction
  model to anticipate NH in T1D patients on MDI. (2) Methods: ten T1D adults were
  studied during 12 weeks. Information regarding T1D management, continuous glucose
  monitoring (CGM), and from a physical activity tracker were obtained under free-living
  conditions at home. Supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied to the data,
  and prediction models were created to forecast the occurrence of NH. Individualized
  prediction models were generated using multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a support
  vector machine (SVM). (3) Results: population outcomes indicated that more than
  70% of the NH may be avoided with the proposed methodology. The predictions performed
  by the SVM achieved the best population outcomes, with a sensitivity and specificity
  of 78.75% and 82.15%, respectively. (4) Conclusions: our study supports the feasibility
  of using ML techniques to address the prediction of nocturnal hypoglycemia in the
  daily life of patients with T1D on MDI, using CGM and a physical activity tracker.'
