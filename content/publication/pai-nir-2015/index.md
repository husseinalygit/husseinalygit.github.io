abstract: The use of near infra red (NIR) photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) for continuous
  non-invasive glucose measurement is outlined in the paper. A photoacoustic (PA)
  measurement apparatus was constructed and PA measurements were made on glucose solutions
  at multiple NIR excitation wavelengths. A variety of time and frequency domain features,
  including amplitude and area based features, were extracted from the PA measurements.
  These features were observed to be proportional to the glucose concentration of
  the sample. PA measurements from samples of whole blood at different glucose concentrations
  showed similar results. Subsequently, in vivo PA measurements made on a cohort of
  30 volunteers were calibrated using a quadratic fit, and the results were compared
  to reference glucose concentrations made using a regular blood glucose meter. A
  comparison of 196 measurement pairs of predicted and reference glucose concentrations
  using a Clarke Error Grid gave a point distribution of 87.24% and 12.76% over zones
  A and B of the grid, with no measurement pairs falling in unacceptable zones C-E
  of the error grid. The predicted measurements had a mean absolute difference (MAD)
  of 12.57 ± 13.90 mg/dl and a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 9.61% ±
  10.55%. This is an improvement over previous results obtained using PAS and other
  non-invasive techniques, validating the potential of PAS for continuous noninvasive
  glucose monitoring.
