abstract: Energy efficiency is one of the most important current challenges, and its
  impact at a global level is considerable. To solve current challenges, it is critical
  that consumers are able to control their energy consumption. In this paper, we propose
  using a time series of window-based entropy to detect anomalies in the electricity
  consumption of a household when the pattern of consumption behavior exhibits a change.
  We compare the accuracy of this approach with two machine learning approaches, random
  forest and neural networks, and with a statistical approach, the ARIMA model. We
  study whether these approaches detect the same anomalous periods. These different
  techniques have been evaluated using a real dataset obtained from different households
  with different consumption profiles from the Madrid Region. The entropy-based algorithm
  detects more days classified as anomalous according to context information compared
  to the other algorithms. This approach has the advantages that it does not require
  a training period and that it adapts dynamically to changes, except in vacation
  periods when consumption drops drastically and requires some time for adapting to
  the new situation.
