abstract: Load forecasting is essential for different activities on power systems,
  and there is extensive research on approaches for forecasting in different time
  horizons, from next-hour to decades. However, because of higher uncertainty and
  variability compared to aggregated or medium and high voltage, the forecasting of
  the individual household load is a current challenge. This paper presents a load
  forecasting for multiple households using Bayesian networks. Our model, which is
  multivariate, uses past consumption, temperature, socioeconomic and electricity
  usage aspects to forecast the next instant household load value. It was tested using
  real data from the Irish smart meter project and its performance was compared with
  other forecasting methods. Results have shown that the proposed approach provides
  consistent single forecast model for hundreds of households with different consumption
  patterns, showing a generalisation capability in an efficient manner.
