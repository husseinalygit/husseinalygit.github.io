abstract: "Smart grid privacy encompasses the privacy of information extracted by
  analysing smart metering data. In this paper, we suggest that home electrical power
  routing can be used to moderate the home's load signature in order to hide appliance
  usage information. In particular, (1) we introduce a power management model using
  a rechargeable battery, (2) we propose a power mixing algorithm, and (3) we evaluate
  its protection level by proposing three different privacy metrics: an information
  theoretic (relative entropy), a clustering classification, and a correlation/regression
  one; these are tested on different metering datasets. This paper sets the ground
  for further research on the subject of optimising home energy management with regards
  to hiding load signatures."
