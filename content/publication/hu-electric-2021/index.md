abstract: Electric vehicles is a hot topic in recent years, and the research on electric
  vehicle is endless. However, at present, there are few researches on the load identification
  technology of electric vehicles, and the load identification technology is very
  single. This paper proposes an electric vehicle load identification method based
  on blind signal separation technology. First, this paper studies the charging characteristics
  of electric vehicle load, which lays a foundation for load identification. Secondly,
  the nonlinear processing and separation algorithm is designed based on blind signal
  separation (BSS) to realize the separation of mixed signals and extract the original
  signals. Finally, the recognition function of electric vehicle load is realized
  according to the membership function. The reliability of the algorithm is verified
  on MATLAB platform.
