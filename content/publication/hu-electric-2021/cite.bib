 abstract = {Electric vehicles is a hot topic in recent years, and the research on electric vehicle is endless. However, at present, there are few researches on the load identification technology of electric vehicles, and the load identification technology is very single. This paper proposes an electric vehicle load identification method based on blind signal separation technology. First, this paper studies the charging characteristics of electric vehicle load, which lays a foundation for load identification. Secondly, the nonlinear processing and separation algorithm is designed based on blind signal separation (BSS) to realize the separation of mixed signals and extract the original signals. Finally, the recognition function of electric vehicle load is realized according to the membership function. The reliability of the algorithm is verified on MATLAB platform.},
