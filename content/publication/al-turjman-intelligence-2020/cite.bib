 abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) envisions a network of medical devices and people, which use wireless communication to enable the exchange of healthcare data. Healthcare costs and prices for services have been increasing with the growing population and the use of advanced technology. The combination of IoMT and healthcare can improve the quality of life, provide better care services and can create more cost-effective systems. This paper introduces the status of IoMT for healthcare industry, including research and development plans and applications. The implementation of the IoMT in healthcare has exponentially increased across the world, but still, it has many technical and design challenges. This paper depicts such challenges and shows a generic IoMT framework that consists of three main components, data acquisition, communication gateways, and servers/cloud, to meet the aforementioned challenges. Finally, this paper discusses the opportunities and prospects of IoMT in practice while emphasizing the corresponding open research issues.},
