abstract: Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) envisions a network of medical devices
  and people, which use wireless communication to enable the exchange of healthcare
  data. Healthcare costs and prices for services have been increasing with the growing
  population and the use of advanced technology. The combination of IoMT and healthcare
  can improve the quality of life, provide better care services and can create more
  cost-effective systems. This paper introduces the status of IoMT for healthcare
  industry, including research and development plans and applications. The implementation
  of the IoMT in healthcare has exponentially increased across the world, but still,
  it has many technical and design challenges. This paper depicts such challenges
  and shows a generic IoMT framework that consists of three main components, data
  acquisition, communication gateways, and servers/cloud, to meet the aforementioned
  challenges. Finally, this paper discusses the opportunities and prospects of IoMT
  in practice while emphasizing the corresponding open research issues.
