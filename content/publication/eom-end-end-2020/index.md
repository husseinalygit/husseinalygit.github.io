abstract: Blood pressure (BP) is a vital sign that provides fundamental health information
  regarding patients. Continuous BP monitoring is important for patients with hypertension.
  Various studies have proposed cuff-less BP monitoring methods using pulse transit
  time. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture using only raw signals
  without the process of extracting features to improve the BP estimation performance
  using the attention mechanism. The proposed model consisted of a convolutional neural
  network, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and an attention mechanism. The model
  was trained by a calibration-based method, using the data of each subject. The performance
  of the model was compared to the model that used each combination of the three signals,
  and the model with the attention mechanism showed better performance than other
  state-of-the-art methods, including conventional linear regression method using
  pulse transit time (PTT). A total of 15 subjects were recruited, and electrocardiogram,
  ballistocardiogram, and photoplethysmogram levels were measured. The 95% confidence
  interval of the reference BP was [86.34, 143.74] and [51.28, 88.74] for systolic
  BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. The      R  2     values were 0.52
  and 0.49, and the mean-absolute-error values were 4.06 &plusmn; 4.04 and 3.33 &plusmn;
  3.42 for SBP and DBP, respectively. In addition, the results complied with global
  standards. The results show the applicability of the proposed model as an analytical
  metric for BP estimation.
