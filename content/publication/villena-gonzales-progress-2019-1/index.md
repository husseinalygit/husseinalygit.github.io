abstract: Current glucose monitoring methods for the ever-increasing number of diabetic
  people around the world are invasive, painful, time-consuming, and a constant burden
  for the household budget. The non-invasive glucose monitoring technology overcomes
  these limitations, for which this topic is significantly being researched and represents
  an exciting and highly sought after market for many companies. This review aims
  to offer an up-to-date report on the leading technologies for non-invasive (NI)
  and minimally-invasive (MI) glucose monitoring sensors, devices currently available
  in the market, regulatory framework for accuracy assessment, new approaches currently
  under study by representative groups and developers, and algorithm types for signal
  enhancement and value prediction. The review also discusses the future trend of
  glucose detection by analyzing the usage of the different bands in the electromagnetic
  spectrum. The review concludes that the adoption and use of new technologies for
  glucose detection is unavoidable and closer to become a reality.
