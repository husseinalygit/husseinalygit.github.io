abstract: "The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method of Rousseeuw (1984) is
  a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Its objective is
  to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant.
  Until now applications of the MCD were hampered by the computation time of existing
  algorithms, which were limited to a few hundred objects in a few dimensions. We
  discuss two important applications of larger size: one about a production process
  at Philips with n = 677 objects and p = 9 variables, and a data set from astronomy
  with n =137,256 objects and p = 27 variables. To deal with such problems we have
  developed a new algorithm for the MCD, called FAST-MCD. The basic ideas are an inequality
  involving order statistics and determinants, and techniques which we call `selective
  iteration' and `nested extensions'. For small data sets FAST-MCD typically finds
  the exact MCD, whereas for larger data sets it gives more accurate results than
  existing algorithms."
