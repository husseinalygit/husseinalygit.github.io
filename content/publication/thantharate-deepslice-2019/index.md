abstract: Existing cellular communications and the upcoming 5G mobile network requires
  meeting high-reliability standards, very low latency, higher capacity, more security,
  and high-speed user connectivity. Mobile operators are looking for a programmable
  solution that will allow them to accommodate multiple independent tenants on the
  same physical infrastructure and 5G networks allow for end-to-end network resource
  allocation using the concept of Network Slicing (NS). Data-driven decision making
  will be vital in future communication networks due to the traffic explosion and
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) will accelerate the 5G network performance. In this
  paper, we have developed a `DeepSlice' model by implementing Deep Learning (DL)
  Neural Network to manage network load efficiency and network availability, utilizing
  in-network deep learning and prediction. We use available network Key Performance
  Indicators (KPIs) to train our model to analyze incoming traffic and predict the
  network slice for an unknown device type. Intelligent resource allocation allows
  us to use the available resources on existing network slices efficiently and offer
  load balancing. Our proposed DeepSlice model will be able to make smart decisions
  and select the most appropriate network slice, even in case of a network failure.
