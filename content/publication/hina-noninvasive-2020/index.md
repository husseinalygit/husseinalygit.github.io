abstract: Conventional glucose monitoring methods for the growing numbers of diabetic
  patients around the world are invasive, painful, costly and, time-consuming. Complications
  aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created
  the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents
  a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared
  (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR).
  The PPG readout circuit consists of a switched capacitor Transimpedance amplifier
  with 1 MΩ gain and a 10-Hz switched capacitor LPF. It allows a DC bias current rejection
  up to 20 μA with an input-referred current noise of 7.3 pA/√Hz. The proposed digital
  processor eliminates motion artifacts, and baseline drifts from PPG signal, extracts
  six distinct features and finally predicts the blood glucose level using Support
  Vector Regression with Fine Gaussian kernel (FGSVR) MLR. A novel piece-wise linear
  (PWL) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the FGSVR on-chip.
  The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with a chip area of
  4.0 mm2 while consuming 1.62 mW. The glucose measurements are performed for 200
  subjects with R2 of 0.937. The proposed system accurately predicts the sugar level
  with a mean absolute relative difference (mARD) of 7.62%.
