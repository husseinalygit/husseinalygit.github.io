abstract: We analyze the increasing threats against IoT devices. We show that Telnet-based
  attacks that target IoT devices have rocketed since 2014. Based on this observation,
  we propose an IoT honeypot and sandbox, which attracts and analyzes Telnet-based
  attacks against various IoT devices running on different CPU architectures such
  as ARM, MIPS, and PPC. By analyzing the observation results of our honeypot and
  captured malware samples, we show that there are currently at least 5 distinct DDoS
  malware families targeting Telnet-enabled IoT devices and one of the families has
  quickly evolved to target more devices with as many as 9 different CPU architectures.
