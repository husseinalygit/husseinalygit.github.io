abstract: Smart grids are the developmental trend of power systems and they have attracted
  much attention all over the world. Due to their complexities, and the uncertainty
  of the smart grid and high volume of information being collected, artificial intelligence
  techniques represent some of the enabling technologies for its future development
  and success. Owing to the decreasing cost of computing power, the profusion of data,
  and better algorithms, AI has entered into its new developmental stage and AI 2.0
  is developing rapidly. Deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL) and their
  combination-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are representative methods and relatively
  mature methods in the family of AI 2.0. This article introduces the concept and
  status quo of the above three methods, summarizes their potential for application
  in smart grids, and provides an overview of the research work on their application
  in smart grids.
