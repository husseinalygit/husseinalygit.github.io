abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) monitoring is not only essential for critically
  ill patients in hospitals or at home, but also for those undergoing exercise testing.
  However, processing PPG signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially
  if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
  that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency
  responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important
  first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local
  maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm
  is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm
  demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84% sensitivity, 99.89%
  positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer's, Li's and Zong's,
  have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents
  an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold
  determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related
  moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic
  peaks, even in heat-stressed PPG signals.
