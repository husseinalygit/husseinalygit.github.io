abstract: Minimizing the occurrence of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes
  is a challenging task since these patients typically check only 1 to 2 self-monitored
  blood glucose (SMBG) readings per day. We trained a probabilistic model using machine
  learning algorithms and SMBG values from real patients. Hypoglycemia was defined
  as a SMBG value textless 70 mg/dL. We validated our model using multiple data sets.
  In addition, we trained a second model, which used patient SMBG values and information
  about patient medication administration. The optimal number of SMBG values needed
  by the model was approximately 10 per week. The sensitivity of the model for predicting
  a hypoglycemia event in the next 24 hours was 92% and the specificity was 70%. In
  the model that incorporated medication information, the prediction window was for
  the hour of hypoglycemia, and the specificity improved to 90%. Our machine learning
  models can predict hypoglycemia events with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.
  These models-which have been validated retrospectively and if implemented in real
  time-could be useful tools for reducing hypoglycemia in vulnerable patients.
