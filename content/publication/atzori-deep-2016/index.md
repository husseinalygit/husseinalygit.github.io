abstract: Natural control methods based on surface electromyography (sEMG) and pattern
  recognition are promising for hand prosthetics. However, the control robustness
  offered by scientific research is still not sufficient for many real life applications,
  and commercial prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few
  movements. In recent years deep learning revolutionized several fields of machine
  learning, including computer vision and speech recognition. Our objective is to
  test its methods for natural control of robotic hands via sEMG using a large number
  of intact subjects and amputees. We tested convolutional networks for the classification
  of an average of 50 hand movements in 67 intact subjects and 11 transradial amputees.
  The simple architecture of the neural network allowed to make several tests in order
  to evaluate the effect of pre-processing, layer architecture, data augmentation
  and optimization. The classification results are compared with a set of classical
  classification methods applied on the same datasets. The classification accuracy
  obtained with convolutional neural networks using the proposed architecture is higher
  than the average results obtained with the classical classification methods, but
  lower than the results obtained with the best reference methods in our tests. The
  results show that convolutional neural networks with a very simple architecture
  can produce accurate results comparable to the average classical classification
  methods. They show that several factors (including pre-processing, the architecture
  of the net and the optimization parameters) can be fundamental for the analysis
  of sEMG data. Larger networks can achieve higher accuracy on computer vision and
  object recognition tasks. This fact suggests that it may be interesting to evaluate
  if larger networks can increase sEMG classification accuracy too.
