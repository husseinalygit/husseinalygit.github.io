abstract: Identification of abnormal power consumption data is a critical and difficult
  task to guarantee efficiency and reliability of the smart grid. This paper proposes
  a power consumption predicting and anomaly detection approach based on LSTM (Long
  Short-Term Memory) neural network. Compared to the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated
  Moving Average) algorithm, LSTM model demonstrates a decrease of 22% in forecasting
  error. Our simulations are performed based on actual power consumption data of ten
  thousands of users from Chongqing, China in the period of one year. Different from
  previous studies, we predict electricity consumption and detect anomaly in long-term
  prospective. We focus on seasonal and monthly trends, instead of power consumption
  pattern from typical commercial and residential buildings at metering granularity
  at once every 15 or 30 minutes. Electricity theft identification is significantly
  improved compared to previous unsupervised algorithms.
