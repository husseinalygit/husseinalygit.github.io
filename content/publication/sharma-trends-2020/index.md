abstract: Audio signal processing algorithms generally involves analysis of signal,
  extracting its properties, predicting its behaviour, recognizing if any pattern
  is present in the signal, and how a particular signal is correlated to another similar
  signals. Audio signal includes music, speech and environmental sounds. Over the
  last few decades, audio signal processing has grown significantly in terms of signal
  analysis and classification. And it has been proven that solutions of many existing
  issues can be solved by integrating the modern machine learning (ML) algorithms
  with the audio signal processing techniques. The performance of any ML algorithm
  depends on the features on which the training and testing is done. Hence feature
  extraction is one of the most vital part of a machine learning process. The aim
  of this study is to summarize the literature of the audio signal processing specially
  focusing on the feature extraction techniques. In this survey the temporal domain,
  frequency domain, cepstral domain, wavelet domain and time-frequency domain features
  are discussed in detail.
