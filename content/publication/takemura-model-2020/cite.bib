 abstract = {Model extraction attacks are an attack in which an adversary utilizes a query access to the target model to obtain a new model whose performance is equivalent to the target model efficiently, i.e., fewer datasets and computational resources than those of the target model. Existing works have dealt with only simple deep neural networks (DNNs), e.g., only three layers, as targets of model extraction attacks, and hence are not aware of the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in dealing with time-series data. In this work, we shed light on the threats of model extraction attacks on RNNs. We discuss whether a model with a higher accuracy can be extracted with a simple RNN from a long short-term memory (LSTM), which is a more complicated and powerful type of RNN. Specifically, we tackle the following problems. First, in case of a classification task, such as image recognition, extraction of an RNN model without final outputs from an LSTM model is presented by utilizing outputs halfway through the sequence. Next, in case of a regression task such as weather forecasting, a new attack by newly configuring a loss function is presented. We conduct experiments on our model extraction attacks on an RNN and an LSTM trained with publicly available academic datasets. We then show that a model with a higher accuracy can be extracted efficiently, especially through configuring a loss function and a more complex architecture different from the target model.},
