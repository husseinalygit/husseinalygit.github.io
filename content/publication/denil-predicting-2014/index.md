abstract: We demonstrate that there is significant redundancy in the parameterization
  of several deep learning models. Given only a few weight values for each feature
  it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that
  not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned
  at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number
  of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more
  than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy.
