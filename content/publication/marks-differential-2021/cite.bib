 abstract = {Smart meters and the smart grid will allow utility companies and customers to monitor their electricity and utility usage in fine-grained detail instead of the previously common monthly or yearly measurements. With this fine-grained detail comes serious privacy concerns. One of the most promising solutions for measuring and preserving privacy loss is differential privacy. Both differential privacy and the smart grid are relatively young developments that will require more research before they can be confidently implemented worldwide. With this systematic mapping study, we will provide an overview of the current literature and attempt to determine the future directions the research may take.},
