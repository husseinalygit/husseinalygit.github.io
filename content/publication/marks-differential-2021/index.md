abstract: Smart meters and the smart grid will allow utility companies and customers
  to monitor their electricity and utility usage in fine-grained detail instead of
  the previously common monthly or yearly measurements. With this fine-grained detail
  comes serious privacy concerns. One of the most promising solutions for measuring
  and preserving privacy loss is differential privacy. Both differential privacy and
  the smart grid are relatively young developments that will require more research
  before they can be confidently implemented worldwide. With this systematic mapping
  study, we will provide an overview of the current literature and attempt to determine
  the future directions the research may take.
