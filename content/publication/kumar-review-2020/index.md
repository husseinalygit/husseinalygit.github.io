abstract: The method of Bio-impedance measurement is achieving preference in huge
  range of biomedical and bioresearch systems due to its non-invasive (NI). This method
  is very important to reduce infection and physical injuries. This review study is
  to mainly focus label brief and prearranged info about various method of non-invasive
  continuous monitoring of blood glucose (BG). Most of the investigation centers have
  been doing continuous blood glucose monitoring by developing the wearable sensors,
  but at current period, there are to our understanding no commercial positively non-invasive
  glucose monitoring (NIGM) on the marketplace. To attain to a suitable sensor system,
  glucose sensor should have accuracy greater than 15mg/dl (0.8 mmol/l). In upcoming
  development, continuous glucose monitoring schemes may become, reliable, predictable
  and selectable for uses of injured persons.
