abstract: 'Background Optical measurement techniques and recent advances in wearable
  technology have made heart rate (HR) sensing simpler and more affordable. Objectives
  The Polar OH1 is an arm worn optical heart rate monitor. The objectives of this
  study are two-fold; 1) to validate the OH1 optical HR sensor with the gold standard
  of HR measurement, electrocardiography (ECG), over a range of moderate to high intensity
  physical activities, 2) to validate wearing the OH1 at the temple as an alternative
  location to its recommended wearing location around the forearm and upper arm. Methods
  Twenty-four individuals participated in a physical exercise protocol, by walking
  on a treadmill and riding a stationary spin bike at different speeds while the criterion
  measure, ECG and Polar OH1 HR were recorded simultaneously at three different body
  locations; forearm, upper arm and the temple. Time synchronised HR data points were
  compared using Bland-Altman analyses and intraclass correlation. Results The intraclass
  correlation between the ECG and Polar OH1, for the aggregated data, was 0.99 and
  the estimated mean bias ranged 0.27–0.33 bpm for the sensor locations. The three
  sensors exhibited a 95% limit of agreement (LoA: forearm 5.22, -4.68 bpm; upper
  arm 5.15, -4.49; temple 5.22, -4.66). The mean of the ECG HR for the aggregated
  data was 112.15 ± 24.52 bpm. The intraclass correlation of HR values below and above
  this mean were 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. The reported mean bias ranged 0.38–0.47
  bpm (95% LoA: forearm 6.14, -5.38 bpm; upper arm 6.07, -5.13 bpm; temple 6.09, -5.31
  bpm), and 0.15–0.16 bpm (95% LoA: forearm 3.99, -3.69 bpm; upper arm 3.90, -3.58
  bpm; temple 4.06, -3.76 bpm) respectively. During different exercise intensities,
  the intraclass correlation ranged 0.95–0.99 for the three sensor locations. During
  the entire protocol, the estimated mean bias was in the range -0.15–0.55 bpm, 0.01–0.53
  bpm and -0.37–0.48 bpm, for the forearm, upper arm and temple locations respectively.
  The corresponding upper limits of 95% LoA were 3.22–7.03 bpm, 3.25–6.82 bpm and
  3.18–7.04 bpm while the lower limits of 95% LoA were -6.36–(-2.35) bpm, -6.46–(-2.30)
  bpm and -7.42–(-2.41) bpm. Conclusion Polar OH1 demonstrates high level of agreement
  with the criterion measure ECG HR, thus can be used as a valid measure of HR in
  lab and field settings during moderate and high intensity physical activities.'
