abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals have unique identity properties for human
  recognition, and are becoming easier to capture by emerging IoT sensors. Existing
  research on PPG-based biometric systems rely on fiducial methods that extract landmarks
  from the PPG signal as features. This paper investigates non-fiducial methods that
  operating in a holistic manner that is less sensitive to noise in landmarks. We
  compare PPG-based human verification of 42 subjects with fiducial and non-fiducial
  methods (specifically, discrete wavelet transform) and classification using a neural
  network and support vector machine. The experimental results demonstrate higher
  test recognition rates for wavelet transform feature extraction. We further improve
  our results by selecting a subset of features via the genetic algorithm.
