abstract: IoT environment merges the digital and physical universes and enabling them
  to communicate real-time data It is crucial to constantly ensure that the user is
  not impersonated which brings a particular type of authentication known as continuous
  authentication. Therefore, this survey is primary attempt to present an overview
  about continuous authentication methods in IoT environment, where Blockchain-related
  solutions provided in this context is also discussed. Subsequently, we overview
  IoT environment and classify IoT attacks based on its layers with the corresponding
  proposed countermeasures. Next, we identify a number of open issues that must be
  taken into account when developing authentication schemes for IoT. We further contribute
  to this survey by providing a comprehensive analysis of designing continuous authentication
  process. Besides, we highlight the primary advantages of continuous authentication
  over the static authentication scheme. In this context, we review relevant works
  that have proposed Blockchain-based solution to strength the security of IoT systems.
  We further contribute to present, analyze, and compare user-related IoT-based continuous
  authentication solutions. Also, we present the solutions that integrate Blockchain.
  Finally, several research directions and open challenges are identified.
