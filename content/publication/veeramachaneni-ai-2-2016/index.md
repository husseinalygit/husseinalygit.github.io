abstract: 'We present AI2, an analyst-in-the-loop security system where Analyst Intuition
  (AI) is put together with state-of-the-art machine learning to build a complete
  end-to-end Artificially Intelligent solution (AI). The system presents four key
  features: a big data behavioral analytics platform, an outlier detection system,
  a mechanism to obtain feedback from security analysts, and a supervised learning
  module. We validate our system with a real-world data set consisting of 3.6 billion
  log lines and 70.2 million entities. The results show that the system is capable
  of learning to defend against unseen attacks. With respect to unsupervised outlier
  analysis, our system improves the detection rate in 2.92× and reduces false positives
  by more than 5×.'
