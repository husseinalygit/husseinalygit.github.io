abstract: This paper reviews electricity consumption feedback literature to explore
  the potential of electricity feedback to affect residential consumersâ€™ electricity
  usage patterns. The review highlights a substantial amount of literature covering
  the debate over the effectiveness of different feedback criteria to residential
  customer acceptance and overall conservation and peak demand reduction. Researchers
  studying the effects of feedback on everyday energy use have observed substantial
  variation in effect size, both within and between studies. Although researchers
  still continue to question the types of feedback that are most effective in encouraging
  conservation and peak load reduction, some trends have emerged. These include that
  feedback be received as quickly as possible to the time of consumption; be related
  to a standard; be clear and meaningful and where possible both direct and indirect
  feedback be customised to the customer. In general, the literature finds that feedback
  can reduce electricity consumption in homes by 5 to 20 percent, but that significant
  gaps remain in our knowledge of the effectiveness and cost benefit of feedback.
