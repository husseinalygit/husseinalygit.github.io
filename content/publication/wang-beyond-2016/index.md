abstract: textlessptextgreaterType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting
  from T cell-mediated β cell destruction in the pancreas of genetically susceptible
  individuals. Extensive familial and population genetic studies uncovered the strong
  linkage and association between textitHLA gene variants and T1D. Non-textitHLA genes
  have also been associated with T1D, such as textitINS, textitCTLA4, and textitPTPN22.
  T1D is considered as one of the most heritable common diseases. However, evidence
  that monozygotic twins have incomplete concordance of disease susceptibility provides
  convincing proof that environmental factors also play important roles in the pathogenesis
  of the disease. Environmental factors can induce the alterations of gene expression
  via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications refer to the alterations in
  gene expression without changes of the DNA sequence, but instead occur as a result
  of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA regulation. Aberrant epigenetic
  modifications will cause the dysregulation of gene expression, thus leading to a
  variety of human diseases. There are significant differences in DNA methylation,
  histone modifications, and miRNA profiling found in T1D patients compared with healthy
  individuals. Epigenetic modifications contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D mainly
  by regulating the expression of susceptible genes in T1D. These susceptible genes
  are involved in antigen presentation (such as textitHLA), immune tolerance (such
  as textitFOXP3 and textitCTLA4), autoreactive T cell response (such as textitGAD65),
  and β cell functions (such as textitINS). A better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms
  for regulating susceptible genes of T1D will help identify candidates that target
  epigenetic pathways to control and/or prevent T1D. Knowledge of epigenetic changes
  in T1D also provides us with potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication,
  personalized treatment, and prevention of the disease.textless/ptextgreater
