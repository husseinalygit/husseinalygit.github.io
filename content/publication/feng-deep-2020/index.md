abstract: Building occupancy patterns facilitate successful development of the smart
  grid by enhancing building-to-grid integration efficiencies. Current occupancy detection
  is limited by the lack of widely deployed non-intrusive sensors and the insufficient
  learning power of shallow machine learning algorithms. This paper seeks to detect
  real-time building occupancy from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data based
  on a deep learning architecture. The developed deep learning model consists of a
  convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.
  Specifically, a CNN with convolutional and max-pooling layers extracts spatial features
  in the AMI data. Then, the forward and backward dependencies within the CNN feature
  maps are learned by a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) structure with three hidden layers.
  Case studies based on a publicly available dataset show that the developed CNN-BiLSTM
  model consistently and robustly outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning
  classifiers and other advanced deep learning architectures with around 90% occupancy
  detection accuracy and high detection confidence.
