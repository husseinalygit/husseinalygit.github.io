abstract: Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive
  cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most
  prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven
  that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures,
  this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties.
  Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure
  estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper,
  a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure
  that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological
  parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing
  and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed
  method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade
  C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension
  Society (BHS) protocol.
