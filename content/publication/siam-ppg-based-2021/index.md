abstract: One of the known problems in security systems is to identify persons based
  on certain signatures. Biometrics have been adopted in security systems to identify
  persons based on some physiological or behavioral characteristics that they own.
  Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a physiological signal that is used to describe the
  volumetric change of blood flow in peripherals with heartbeats. The PPG signals
  gained some interest of researchers in the last few years, because they are used
  non-invasively, and they are easily captured by the emerging IoT sensors from fingertips.
  This paper presents a PPG-based approach to identify persons using a neural network
  classifier. Firstly, PPG signals are captured from a number of persons using IoT
  sensors. Then, unique features are extracted from captured PPG signals by estimating
  the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). These features are fed into an
  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to be trained first and used for identification
  of persons. A dataset of PPG signals for 35 healthy persons was collected to test
  the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate 100%
  and 98.07% accuracy levels using the hold-out method and the 10-fold cross-validation
  method, respectively.
