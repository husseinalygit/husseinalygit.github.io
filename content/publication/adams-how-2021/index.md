abstract: The goal of this literature review was to outline the research currently
  conducted on smart meter (SM) adoption and its connection to building occupant behavior
  to better understand both SM technology and SM customers. We compiled our findings
  from the existing literature and developed a holistic understanding of the socio-demographic
  factors that lead to more or less energy use, the methods used to group and cluster
  occupants on the basis of energy use, how occupant energy use profiles are developed,
  and which socio-psychological determinants may influence SM adoption. Our results
  highlight 11 demographic variables that impact building energy use, find 9 methods
  commonly used to profile occupants on the basis of energy usage, and highlight 13
  socio-psychological variables than can be utilized to better understand SM adoption
  intentions. The review findings two major deficiencies in the existing literature.
  First, this review highlights the lack of existing interdisciplinary research that
  combines occupant behavior with SM data and a clear socio-psychological framework.
  Second, this review underscores certain data limitations in existing SM research,
  with most research being conducted only on residential or office buildings and geographically
  in North America or Western Europe. Final policy recommendations center on increased
  need for interdisciplinary SM research and the need for an expanded understanding
  of occupant behavior and SM research across different geographies.
