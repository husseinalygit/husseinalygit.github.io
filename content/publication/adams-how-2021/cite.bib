 abstract = {The goal of this literature review was to outline the research currently conducted on smart meter (SM) adoption and its connection to building occupant behavior to better understand both SM technology and SM customers. We compiled our findings from the existing literature and developed a holistic understanding of the socio-demographic factors that lead to more or less energy use, the methods used to group and cluster occupants on the basis of energy use, how occupant energy use profiles are developed, and which socio-psychological determinants may influence SM adoption. Our results highlight 11 demographic variables that impact building energy use, find 9 methods commonly used to profile occupants on the basis of energy usage, and highlight 13 socio-psychological variables than can be utilized to better understand SM adoption intentions. The review findings two major deficiencies in the existing literature. First, this review highlights the lack of existing interdisciplinary research that combines occupant behavior with SM data and a clear socio-psychological framework. Second, this review underscores certain data limitations in existing SM research, with most research being conducted only on residential or office buildings and geographically in North America or Western Europe. Final policy recommendations center on increased need for interdisciplinary SM research and the need for an expanded understanding of occupant behavior and SM research across different geographies.},
