abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for malware detection has been
  a trend in the last two decades. More recently, researchers started to investigate
  adversarial approaches to bypass these ML-based malware detectors. Adversarial attacks
  became so popular that a large Internet company has launched a public challenge
  to encourage researchers to bypass their (three) ML-based static malware detectors.
  Our research group teamed to participate in this challenge in August/2019, accomplishing
  the bypass of all 150 tests proposed by the company. To do so, we implemented an
  automatic exploitation method which moves the original malware binary sections to
  resources and includes new chunks of data to it to create adversarial samples that
  not only bypassed their ML detectors, but also real AV engines as well (with a lower
  detection rate than the original samples). In this paper, we detail our methodological
  approach to overcome the challenge and report our findings. With these results,
  we expect to contribute with the community and provide better understanding on ML-based
  detectors weaknesses. We also pinpoint future research directions toward the development
  of more robust malware detectors against adversarial machine learning.
