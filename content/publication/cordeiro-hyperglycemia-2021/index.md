abstract: A growing number of smart wearable biosensors are operating in the medical
  IoT environment and those that capture physiological signals have received special
  attention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the physiological signals used in the
  cardiovascular and medical fields that has encouraged researchers to discover new
  non-invasive methods to diagnose hyperglycemia as a personal variable. Over the
  years, researchers have proposed different techniques to detect hyperglycemia using
  ECG. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that can identify
  hyperglycemia using heartbeats from ECG signals. In addition, we introduce a new
  fiducial feature extraction technique that improves the performance of the deep
  learning classifier. We evaluate the proposed method with ECG data from 1119 different
  subjects to assess the efficiency of hyperglycemia detection of the proposed work.
  The result indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting hyperglycemia
  with a 94.53% area under the curve (AUC), 87.57% sensitivity, and 85.04% specificity.
  That performance represents an relative improvement of 53% versus the best model
  found in the literature. The high sensitivity and specificity achieved by the 10-layer
  deep neural network proposed in this work provide an excellent indication that ECG
  possesses intrinsic information that can indicate the level of blood glucose concentration.
