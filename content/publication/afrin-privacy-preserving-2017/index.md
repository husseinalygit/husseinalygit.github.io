abstract: The Smart Grid (SG) is an emerging modernized electrical power system with
  advanced monitoring and control mechanism, and improved fault-tolerance. Electric
  Vehicles (EVs), with their energy storage capability, are gaining popularity as
  an integral part of the energy management system in the SG. To balance the load-demand
  condition of the grid, EVs are required to schedule a charging event before participation.
  However, the information transmitted by an EV in charging events can reveal personal
  information of its owner. The privacy-preserving methods for EVs in existing literature
  are based on anonymous authentication mechanism, where, missing a charging event
  by an EV is considered as malicious and the EV is penalized. However, missing a
  charging event may happen due to many valid reasons and flexibility of scheduling
  can encourage consumer participation. In this paper, an authentication method is
  proposed to achieve anonymity and flexibility in charging events for EVs. Additionally,
  a charging station network setup that divides a large regional area into smaller
  zones to improve privacy, is proposed. Results based on a MATLAB simulation are
  presented to demonstrate the Degree of Anonymity (DoA) achieved in different stages
  of the proposed method, the optimal number of missed charging events, and sub-division
  of zones.
