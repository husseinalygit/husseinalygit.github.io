abstract: Wearable devices have flourished over the past ten years providing great
  advantages to people and, recently, they have also been used for identity authentication.
  Most of the authentication methods adopt a one-time authentication manner which
  cannot provide continuous certification. To address this issue, we present a two-step
  authentication method based on an own-built fingertip sensor device which can capture
  motion data (e.g., acceleration and angular velocity) and physiological data (e.g.,
  a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal) simultaneously. When the device is worn on
  the userâ€™s fingertip, it will automatically recognize whether the wearer is a legitimate
  user or not. More specifically, multisensor data is collected and analyzed to extract
  representative and intensive features. Then, human activity recognition is applied
  as the first step to enhance the practicability of the authentication system. After
  correctly discriminating the motion state, a one-class machine learning algorithm
  is applied for identity authentication as the second step. When a user wears the
  device, the authentication process is carried on automatically at set intervals.
  Analyses were conducted using data from 40 individuals across various operational
  scenarios. Extensive experiments were executed to examine the effectiveness of the
  proposed approach, which achieved an average accuracy rate of 98.5% and an F1-score
  of 86.67%. Our results suggest that the proposed scheme provides a feasible and
  practical solution for authentication.
