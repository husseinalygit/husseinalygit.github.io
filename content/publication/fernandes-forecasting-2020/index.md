abstract: Heating appliances consume approximately     48 %    of the energy spent
  on household appliances every year. Furthermore, a malfunctioning device can increase
  the cost even further. Thus, there is a need to create methods that can identify
  the equipment’s malfunctions and eventual failures before they occur. This is only
  possible with a combination of data acquisition, analysis and prediction/forecast.
  This paper presents an infrastructure that supports the previously mentioned capabilities
  and was deployed for failure detection in boilers, making possible to forecast faults
  and errors. We also present our initial predictive maintenance models based on the
  collected data.
