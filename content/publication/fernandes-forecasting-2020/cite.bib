%



of the energy spent on household appliances every year. Furthermore, a malfunctioning device can increase the cost even further. Thus, there is a need to create methods that can identify the equipment’s malfunctions and eventual failures before they occur. This is only possible with a combination of data acquisition, analysis and prediction/forecast. This paper presents an infrastructure that supports the previously mentioned capabilities and was deployed for failure detection in boilers, making possible to forecast faults and errors. We also present our initial predictive maintenance models based on the collected data.},
