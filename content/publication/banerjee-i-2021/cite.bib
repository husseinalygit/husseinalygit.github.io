 abstract = {The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor is found in most smart wearables and fitness trackers to support the physical wellness monitoring of it's user. The popularity of this sensor has encouraged the exploration of it's use in other domains particularly in the field of banking, education, training, wellness etc. as a form of biometric authentication. These studies are however limited in the evaluation of the sensor in the wild. We created several datasets of continuous in-the-wild PPG across multiple participants and devices and propose the use of different statistical, signal processing and machine learning based techniques to support zero re-authentications using in-situ PPG data.},
