abstract: The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor is found in most smart wearables and
  fitness trackers to support the physical wellness monitoring of it's user. The popularity
  of this sensor has encouraged the exploration of it's use in other domains particularly
  in the field of banking, education, training, wellness etc. as a form of biometric
  authentication. These studies are however limited in the evaluation of the sensor
  in the wild. We created several datasets of continuous in-the-wild PPG across multiple
  participants and devices and propose the use of different statistical, signal processing
  and machine learning based techniques to support zero re-authentications using in-situ
  PPG data.
