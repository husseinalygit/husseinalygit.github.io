abstract: We discuss the role of random basis function approximators in modeling and
  control. We analyze the published work on random basis function approximators and
  demonstrate that their favorable error rate of convergence O(1/n) is guaranteed
  only with very substantial computational resources. We also discuss implications
  of our analysis for applications of neural networks in modeling and control.
