abstract: Technological advancements in the field of electrical energy distribution
  and utilization are revolutionizing the way consumers and utility providers interact.
  In addition to allowing utility companies to monitor the status of their network
  independently in autonomous fashion, data collected by smart meters as part of the
  wider advanced metering infrastructure, can be valuable for third parties, such
  as government authorities. The availability of the information, the granularity
  of the data, and the real-time nature of the smart meter, means that predictive
  analytics can be employed to profile consumers with high accuracy and approximate,
  for example, the number of individuals living in a house, the type of appliances
  being used, or the duration of occupancy, to name but a few applications. This paper
  presents a machine learning model comparison for unemployment prediction of single
  household occupants, based on features extracted from smart meter electricity readings.
  A number of nonlinear classifiers are compared, and benchmarked against a generalized
  linear model, and the results presented. To ensure the robustness of the classifiers,
  we use repeated cross validation. The results revealed that it is possible to predict
  employability status with Area Under Curve (AUC) = 74%, Sensitivity (SE) = 54% and
  Specificity (SP) = 83%, using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout,
  closely followed by the results produced by a distance weighted discrimination with
  polynomial kernel model. This shows the potential of using the smart metering infrastructure
  to provide additional autonomous services, such as unemployment detection, for governments
  using data collected from an advanced and distributed Internet of Things (IoT) sensor
  network.
