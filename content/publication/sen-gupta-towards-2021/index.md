abstract: Diabetes, the result of excessive or uncontrolled glucose in the blood,
  is one of the leading causes of human mortality. Due to the unavailability of non-invasive
  glucose level checker until now, the most trustworthy day-to-day life glucose test
  for personal healthcare is the use of glucometer in which case painful finger pricking
  is an obvious part. However, researches have been done to prove the usage of pulse
  oximeter to measure the blood glucose level besides other physiological indicators
  such as heart rate, percentage of blood oxygen, etc. Here, as the first of two studies,
  we try to develop an all-purpose commercial prototype photoplethysmography (PPG)
  system to monitor necessary health indicator parameters in a non-invasive way. The
  developed fingertip PPG device consists of both transmissive and reflective type
  data acquisition system after illuminating the skin with red, green, and IR LEDs.
  Next, as the second study, special consideration is given to prove the efficiency
  of the device for measuring blood glucose level (BGL). To measure blood glucose
  from PPG signal, a few discriminative and related features are extracted from the
  obtained PPG signals. Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict the actual
  value of BGL from the extracted features. The proposed algorithm and system can
  predict the BGL level with a level of clinical accuracy. In the Clarke error grid
  plot, 96.15% and 3.85% of data are in the zone A and zone B, respectively, with
  0% data in the critical zones.
