abstract: We propose a robust and efficient lung sound classification system using
  a snapshot ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A robust CNN architecture
  is used to extract high-level features from log mel spectrograms. The CNN architecture
  is trained on a cosine cycle learning rate schedule. Capturing the best model of
  each training cycle allows to obtain multiple models settled on various local optima
  from cycle to cycle at the cost of training a single mode. Therefore, the snapshot
  ensemble boosts performance of the proposed system while keeping the drawback of
  expensive training of ensembles moderate. To deal with the class-imbalance of the
  dataset, temporal stretching and vocal tract length perturbation (VTLP) for data
  augmentation and the focal loss objective are used. Empirically, our system outperforms
  state-of-the-art systems for the prediction task of four classes (normal, crackles,
  wheezes, and both crackles and wheezes) and two classes (normal and abnormal (i.e.
  crackles, wheezes, and both crackles and wheezes)) and achieves 78.4% and 83.7%
  ICBHI specific micro-averaged accuracy, respectively. The average accuracy is repeated
  on ten random splittings of 80% training and 20% testing data using the ICBHI 2017
  dataset of respiratory cycles.
