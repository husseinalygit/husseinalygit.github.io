abstract: With the widespread use of real-time sensors in various fields, such as
  IoT systems, it is important to improve the performance of most network traffic
  anomaly detection methods, which have low accuracy and high false alarm rates. However,
  there are two key challenges to address. In this study, we proposed a personalized
  federated anomaly detection framework for network traffic anomaly detection, in
  which data are aggregated under the premise of privacy protection and relatively
  personalized models are constructed by fine-tuning. Subsequently, a network traffic
  anomaly detection method based on the self-coding of long- and short-term memory
  networks was proposed. Real network traffic was tested to analyze the effects of
  the model structure and external noise on the detection performance, and the experimental
  results verified the correctness of the proposed method. Compared with other data-reconstruction-based
  detection methods, the proposed method has higher detection accuracy and better
  detection performance.
