 abstract = {This paper presents a case study where Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied to nontextual data. Traditionally NLP is applied to text data as it is meant for natural language. In this study, we explore the effects of NLP on non-textual data. Our motivation behind this study is that if the training data for the NLP algorithm meets proper semantic and syntactic analysis of the algorithm, it would provide meaningful interpretation for the non-textual data just as it works for text data. Speciﬁcally, we apply word2vec, a neural embedding model developed by Google, to detect types of attacks in network log data. Our proposed mechanisms rely on machine learning techniques for studying anomalies in network log data. We ﬁrst describe how word2vec works and how it proves to be useful to ﬁnd the semantic of a particular network attack types, which then can be used by other classiﬁcation based machine learning algorithms, like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).},
