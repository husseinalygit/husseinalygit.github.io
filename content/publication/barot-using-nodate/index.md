abstract: This paper presents a case study where Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  techniques are applied to nontextual data. Traditionally NLP is applied to text
  data as it is meant for natural language. In this study, we explore the effects
  of NLP on non-textual data. Our motivation behind this study is that if the training
  data for the NLP algorithm meets proper semantic and syntactic analysis of the algorithm,
  it would provide meaningful interpretation for the non-textual data just as it works
  for text data. Speciﬁcally, we apply word2vec, a neural embedding model developed
  by Google, to detect types of attacks in network log data. Our proposed mechanisms
  rely on machine learning techniques for studying anomalies in network log data.
  We ﬁrst describe how word2vec works and how it proves to be useful to ﬁnd the semantic
  of a particular network attack types, which then can be used by other classiﬁcation
  based machine learning algorithms, like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
