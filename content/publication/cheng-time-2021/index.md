abstract: Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) is popular among researchers in many
  areas of machine learning. RVFL is preferred by many researchers as RVFL can produce
  good performance with relatively little training time. Recent works extend RVFL
  into deep and ensemble versions. However, RVFL does not have effective feature extraction
  methods commonly used in time series classification. This results in poor performance
  of RVFL in time series classification tasks. Also, deep RVFL is a relatively new
  and evolving area of research. In this paper, we present a framework that extracts
  features from Residual Networks (Resnet) and trains Ensemble Deep Random Vector
  Functional Link (edRVFL). We use features extracted from every residual block to
  train an ensemble of edRVFLs. We propose the following enhancements to edRVFL. Firstly,
  we diversity the structure of edRVFL and the direct link features to encourage diversity.
  Secondly, we built an ensemble of edRVFLs with the top two activation functions.
  Thirdly, we use two-stage tuning to save computational costs. Lastly, we perform
  a weighted average of all decisions made by every edRVFL. Experiments on the 55
  largest UCR datasets show that using features extracted from all Residual blocks
  improves performance. All our proposed enhancements help improve classification
  accuracy or computational effort. Consequently, our proposed framework outperforms
  all traditional and deep learning-based time series classification methods.
