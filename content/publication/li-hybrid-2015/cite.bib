 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid malicious code detection scheme based on AutoEncoder and DBN (Deep Belief Networks). Firstly, we use the AutoEncoder deep learning method to reduce the dimensionality of data. This could convert complicated high-dimensional data into low dimensional codes with the nonlinear mapping, thereby reducing the dimensionality of data, extracting the main features of the data; then using DBN learning method to detect malicious code. DBN is composed of multilayer Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM, Restricted Boltzmann Machine) and a layer of BP neural network. Based on unsupervised training of every layer of RBM, we make the output vector of the last layer of RBM as the input vectors of BP neural network, then conduct supervised training to the BP neural network, finally achieve the optimal hybrid model by fine-tuning the entire network. After inputting testing samples into the hybrid model, the experimental results show that the detection accuracy getting by the hybrid detection method proposed in this paper is higher than that of single DBN. The proposed method reduces the time complexity and has better detection performance.},
