abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid malicious code detection scheme based
  on AutoEncoder and DBN (Deep Belief Networks). Firstly, we use the AutoEncoder deep
  learning method to reduce the dimensionality of data. This could convert complicated
  high-dimensional data into low dimensional codes with the nonlinear mapping, thereby
  reducing the dimensionality of data, extracting the main features of the data; then
  using DBN learning method to detect malicious code. DBN is composed of multilayer
  Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM, Restricted Boltzmann Machine) and a layer of
  BP neural network. Based on unsupervised training of every layer of RBM, we make
  the output vector of the last layer of RBM as the input vectors of BP neural network,
  then conduct supervised training to the BP neural network, finally achieve the optimal
  hybrid model by fine-tuning the entire network. After inputting testing samples
  into the hybrid model, the experimental results show that the detection accuracy
  getting by the hybrid detection method proposed in this paper is higher than that
  of single DBN. The proposed method reduces the time complexity and has better detection
  performance.
