abstract: Integration of renewable resources and increased growth in energy consumption
  has created new challenges for the traditional electrical network. To adhere to
  these challenges, Internet of EverythingÂ (IoE) has transformed the existing power
  grid into a modernized electrical network called Smart Grid. An integral part of
  this transformation is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which enables
  two-way communication for flow of information consisting of energy consumption,
  outages, and electricity rates between smart meters and the utilities. These enhanced
  AMI features and privileges have resulted in a larger surface for cyber-attack,
  enabling remote exploitation of these smart devices without any physical access.
  Therefore, consumer privacy and security has become a critical issue due to the
  interconnection of different smart devices in various communication networks and
  the information they carry. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
  privacy related research in the IoE enabled smart grid environment. The survey presents
  a detailed analysis of privacy problems and their corresponding solutions in AMI.
  Our goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the smart grid and shed light
  on future research directions.
