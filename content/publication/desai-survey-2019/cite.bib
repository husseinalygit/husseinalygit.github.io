 abstract = {Integration of renewable resources and increased growth in energy consumption has created new challenges for the traditional electrical network. To adhere to these challenges, Internet of EverythingÂ (IoE) has transformed the existing power grid into a modernized electrical network called Smart Grid. An integral part of this transformation is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which enables two-way communication for flow of information consisting of energy consumption, outages, and electricity rates between smart meters and the utilities. These enhanced AMI features and privileges have resulted in a larger surface for cyber-attack, enabling remote exploitation of these smart devices without any physical access. Therefore, consumer privacy and security has become a critical issue due to the interconnection of different smart devices in various communication networks and the information they carry. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of privacy related research in the IoE enabled smart grid environment. The survey presents a detailed analysis of privacy problems and their corresponding solutions in AMI. Our goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the smart grid and shed light on future research directions.},
