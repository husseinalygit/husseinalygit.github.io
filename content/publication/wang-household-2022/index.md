abstract: Accurate household profiles (e.g., house type, number of occupants) identification
  is the key to the successful implementation of behavioral demand response. Currently,
  supervised learning methods are widely adopted to identify household profiles using
  smart meter data. Such methods could achieve promising performance in the case of
  sufficient labeled data but show low accuracy if labeled data is insufficient or
  even unavailable. However, the acquisition of accurately labeled data (usually obtained
  by survey) is very difficult, costly, and time-consuming in practice due to various
  reasons such as privacy concerns. To this end, a semi-supervised learning approach
  is proposed in this paper to address the above issues. Firstly, 78 preliminary features
  reflecting the household profiles information are extracted from both time and frequency
  domain. Secondly, feature selection methods are introduced to select more relevant
  ones as the input of the identification model from the preliminary features. Thirdly,
  a transductive support vector machine method is adopted to learn the mapping relation
  between the input features and the output household profile identification results.
  Case study on an Irish dataset indicates that the proposed approach outperforms
  supervised learning methods when only limited labeled data is available. Furthermore,
  the impacts of different feature selection methods (i.e., Filter, Wrapper and Embedding
  methods) are also investigated, among which the wrapper method performs best, and
  the identification accuracy improves with the increase of data resolution.
