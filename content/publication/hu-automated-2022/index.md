abstract: The randomized feed-forward neural network is a single hidden layer feed-forward
  neural network that enables efficient learning by optimizing only the output weights.
  The ensemble deep learning framework significantly improves the performance of randomized
  neural networks. However, the frameworkâ€™s capabilities are limited by traditional
  hyper-parameter selection approaches. Meanwhile, different random network architectures,
  such as the existence or lack of a direct link and the mapping of direct links,
  can also strongly affect the results. We present an automated learning pipeline
  for the ensemble deep randomized feed-forward neural network in this paper, which
  integrates hyper-parameter selection and randomized network architectural search
  via Bayesian optimization to ensure robust performance. Experiments on 46 UCI tabular
  datasets show that our strategy produces state-of-the-art performance on various
  tabular datasets among a range of randomized networks and feed-forward neural networks.
  We also conduct ablation studies to investigate the impact of various hyper-parameters
  and network architectures.
