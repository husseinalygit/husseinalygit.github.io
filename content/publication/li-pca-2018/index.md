abstract: For the functional control of prosthetic hand, it is insufficient to obtain
  only the motion pattern information. As far as practicality is concerned, the control
  of the prosthetic hand force is indispensable. The application value of prosthetic
  hand will be greatly improved if the stable grip of prosthetic hand can be achieved.
  To address this problem, in this study, a bio-signal control method for grasping
  control of a prosthetic hand is proposed to improve patientâ€™s sense of using prosthetic
  hand and the thus improving the quality of life.
