abstract: Amongst all medical biometric traits, Photoplethysmograph (PPG) is the easiest
  to acquire. PPG records the blood volume change with just combination of Light Emitting
  Diode and Photodiode from any part of the body. With IoT and smart homes' penetration,
  PPG recording can easily be integrated with other vital wearable devices. PPG represents
  peculiarity of hemodynamics and cardiovascular system for each individual. This
  paper presents nonfiducial method for PPG based biometric authentication. Being
  a physiological signal, PPG signal alters with physical/mental stress and time.
  For robustness, these variations cannot be ignored. While, most of the previous
  works focused only on single session, this paper demonstrates extensive performance
  evaluation of PPG biometrics against single session data, different emotions, physical
  exercise and time-lapse using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Direct Linear
  Discriminant Analysis (DLDA). When evaluated on different states and datasets, equal
  error rate (EER) of 0.5%-6% was achieved for 45-60s average training time. Our CWT/DLDA
  based technique outperformed all other dimensionality reduction techniques and previous
  works.
