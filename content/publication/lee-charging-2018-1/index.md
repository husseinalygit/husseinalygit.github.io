abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) have advanced significantly this decade, owing in
  part to decreasing battery costs. Yet EVs remain more costly than gasoline fueled
  vehicles over their useful life. This paper analyzes the additional advances that
  will be needed, if electric vehicles are to significantly penetrate the passenger
  vehicle fleet.
