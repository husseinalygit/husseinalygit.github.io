abstract: Treatment of lung diseases, which are the third most common cause of death
  in the world, is of great importance in the medical field. Many studies using lung
  sounds recorded with stethoscope have been conducted in the literature in order
  to diagnose the lung diseases with artificial intelligence-compatible devices and
  to assist the experts in their diagnosis. In this paper, ICBHI 2017 database which
  includes different sample frequencies, noise and background sounds was used for
  the classification of lung sounds. The lung sound signals were initially converted
  to spectrogram images by using time–frequency method. The short time Fourier transform
  (STFT) method was considered as time–frequency transformation. Two deep learning
  based approaches were used for lung sound classification. In the first approach,
  a pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was used for feature
  extraction and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used in classification
  of the lung sounds. In the second approach, the pre-trained deep CNN model was fine-tuned
  (transfer learning) via spectrogram images for lung sound classification. The accuracies
  of the proposed methods were tested by using the ten-fold cross validation. The
  accuracies for the first and second proposed methods were 65.5% and 63.09%, respectively.
  The obtained accuracies were then compared with some of the existing results and
  it was seen that obtained scores were better than the other results.
