abstract: 'We evaluate 179 classifiers arising from 17 families (discriminant analysis,
  Bayesian, neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, rule-based classifiers,
  boosting, bagging, stacking, random forests and other ensembles, generalized linear
  models, nearest-neighbors, partial least squares and principal component regression,
  logistic and multinomial regression, multiple adaptive regression splines and other
  methods), implemented in Weka, R (with and without the caret package), C and Matlab,
  including all the relevant classifiers available today. We use 121 data sets, which
  represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large- scale problems) and other
  own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier
  behavior, not dependent on the data set collection. The classifiers most likely
  to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented
  in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1% of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90%
  in the 84.3% of the data sets. However, the difference is not statistically significant
  with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM,
  which achieves 92.3% of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than
  the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme
  learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer
  perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly
  the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by
  SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and
  3 members in the top-20, respectively)'
