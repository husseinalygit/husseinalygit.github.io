abstract: Nowadays, there is a global change in lifestyle that is moving more toward
  the use of e-services and smart devices which necessitate the verification of user
  identity. Different organizations have put into place a range of technologies, hardware,
  and/or software to authenticate users using fingerprints, iris recognition, and
  so forth. However, cost and reliability are significant limitations to the use of
  such technologies. This study presents a nonfiducial PPG-based subject authentication
  system. In particular, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal is first filtered into
  four signals using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and then segmented into
  frames. Ten simple statistical features are extracted from the frame of each signal
  band to compose the feature vector. Augmenting the feature vector with the same
  features extracted from the 1st derivative of the corresponding signal is investigated,
  along with different fusion approaches. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier
  is then employed for the purpose of identity authentication. The proposed authentication
  system achieved an average authentication accuracy of 99.3% using a 15â€‰sec frame
  length with the augmented multiband approach.
