abstract: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a major threat currently observable
  in computer networks and especially the Internet. In such an attack a malicious
  party tries to either break a service, running on a server, or exhaust the capacity
  or bandwidth of the victim to hinder customers to effectively use the service. Recent
  reports show that the total number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
  is steadily growing with \"mega-attacks\" peaking at hundreds of gigabit/s (Gbps).
  In this paper, we will provide a quantification of DDoS attacks in size and duration
  beyond these outliers reported in the media. We find that these mega attacks do
  exist, but the bulk of attacks is in practice only a fraction of these frequently
  reported values. We further show that it is feasible to collect meaningful backscatter
  traces using surprisingly small telescopes, thereby enabling a broader audience
  to perform attack intelligence research.
