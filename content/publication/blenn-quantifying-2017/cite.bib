 abstract = {Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a major threat currently observable in computer networks and especially the Internet. In such an attack a malicious party tries to either break a service, running on a server, or exhaust the capacity or bandwidth of the victim to hinder customers to effectively use the service. Recent reports show that the total number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is steadily growing with "mega-attacks" peaking at hundreds of gigabit/s (Gbps). In this paper, we will provide a quantification of DDoS attacks in size and duration beyond these outliers reported in the media. We find that these mega attacks do exist, but the bulk of attacks is in practice only a fraction of these frequently reported values. We further show that it is feasible to collect meaningful backscatter traces using surprisingly small telescopes, thereby enabling a broader audience to perform attack intelligence research.},
