 abstract = {In the smart grid and big data environment, accurate and large amount of power load data for users can be obtained with the wide application of non-intrusive load monitoring technology. In the research process of customers’ information, information security protection of users’ electricity data has become a research hotspot urgently. This article proposes a new type of load decomposition method for electric vehicle load information and compares it with hidden Markov model algorithm to verify its accuracy. On this basis, the elliptic curve encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the users’ electricity data, and the function and effectiveness of the encryption algorithm are verified by comparing the load decomposition of the electric vehicle with the unencrypted data.},
