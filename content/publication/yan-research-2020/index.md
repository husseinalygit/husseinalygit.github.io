abstract: In the smart grid and big data environment, accurate and large amount of
  power load data for users can be obtained with the wide application of non-intrusive
  load monitoring technology. In the research process of customers’ information, information
  security protection of users’ electricity data has become a research hotspot urgently.
  This article proposes a new type of load decomposition method for electric vehicle
  load information and compares it with hidden Markov model algorithm to verify its
  accuracy. On this basis, the elliptic curve encryption algorithm is used to encrypt
  the users’ electricity data, and the function and effectiveness of the encryption
  algorithm are verified by comparing the load decomposition of the electric vehicle
  with the unencrypted data.
