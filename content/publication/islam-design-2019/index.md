abstract: Among current issues that are challenging to be dealt with in medical science,
  Diabetes is a noteworthy one. A good number of invasive techniques to measure blood
  glucose levels have been devised in the past few decades that had been a mixed blessing
  because it carried multiple limitations along with beneficial sides. Pain, discomfort,
  and risks of pathogenic infection were some of the basic drawbacks. So, per the
  demand of time, our main objective of this paper is to introduce a method of blood
  glucose level measurement that is non-invasive and can overcome the former limitations
  with better accuracy in a very cost-effective way. Blood glucose concentration can
  be measured using the PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal. But to gain higher accuracy
  we need to consider the physiological variations which lead to erroneous measurement
  of glucose levels. Using GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) sensor data, these perturbations
  can be minimized. So, in our model PPG sensor and GSR sensor have been used to accurately
  measure blood glucose levels. Extracted data from these two sensors as well as recorded
  blood glucose measurement using conventional glucometer were applied in a deep learning
  algorithm to measure blood glucose level non-invasively. Then the output of our
  proposed system was compared to conventional invasive technique. The results showed
  that our proposed multi sensor-based system improves prediction error of glucose
  level.
