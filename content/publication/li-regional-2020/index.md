abstract: Electricity network is leading to a low carbon future with high penetration
  of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). However, it is extraordinarily difficult to
  acquire detailed information on regional EV electrification with an incomplete monitoring
  system for network operators. In this study, a flexible graph signal processing
  (GSP)-based non-intrusive monitoring on aggregated EVs is proposed to enhance the
  EVs visibility for operating power system safely and cost-efficiently. It can deduce
  the individual EV charging status with the highest possibility iteratively from
  the limited dataset using a GSP-based possibility calculation after processing a
  daytime EV characteristic charging patterns. The experiment is developed with realistic
  EV charging datasets collected in London, and the results show the daily EVs number
  in a specific region of 500 EVs daily aggregation can be estimated efficiently with
  an around 4.77% value of relative mean absolute deviation applying the proposed
  method.
