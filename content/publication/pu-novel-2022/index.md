abstract: As the tremendous advances in the biosensing technology, the biometric authentication
  approach has been adopted to replace the conventional password-based systems. Due
  to their harmless nature, photoplethysmogram (PPG) related applications have been
  quite intriguing in recent years. PPG can measure volumetric blood-flow changes
  in the peripheral circulation. Because PPG signals are very easy to acquire, compared
  to other biometrics (fingerprints, iris/retina, etc.), especially by low-cost wearable
  electronic devices, they are widely adopted to measure heart rates. In this paper,
  we devise a novel robust PPG based authentication system, which is capable of continuously
  authenticating the user instead of one-time authentication as carried out by the
  conventional techniques. This new system consists of preprocessing and filtering,
  motion artifact (MA) removal, template and feature extraction, and training. The
  associated multiwavelet-based feature extraction mechanism facilitates more reliable
  features than the conventional scalar-wavelet schemes so that it allows the learning
  model to better distinguish users. The associated autoencoder perfectly transforms
  the input PPG signal into the latent space. Finally, any distance measure can be
  adopted to classify or authenticate users. In order to build a sufficiently large
  dataset, we have combined three public datasets and our own dataset collected by
  ourselves locally together to create a new dataset consisting of 120 subjects totally.
  We have already built the hardware prototype successfully for real-time training
  data collection and real-time authentication. The equal-error-rate at the authentication
  stage reaches 5.5% and the identification accuracy reaches 98% at the identification
  stage.
