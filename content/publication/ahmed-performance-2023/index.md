abstract: 'Introduction Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by impaired ability
  to metabolize glucose for use in cells for energy, resulting in high blood sugar
  (hyperglycemia). DM impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over
  four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels (BGL) are usually measured,
  as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate BGL using data
  collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices (WDs), thereby, facilitating monitoring
  and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of WDs with machine learning
  (ML) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers,
  that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition.
  The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in
  technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive
  WDs. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics
  acquired from non-invasive WDs and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much
  work is needed to validate accuracy. Research Design & Methods The study aimed to
  investigate performance of AI models in estimating BGL among diabetic patients using
  non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided
  BGL readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen
  level (SPO2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature,
  Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from WDs. Our experimental
  design included Data Collection, Feature Engineering, ML model selection/development,
  and reporting evaluation of metrics. Results We were able to estimate with high
  accuracy (RMSE range: 0.099 to 0.197) the relationship between glycemic metrics
  and features that can be derived from non-invasive WDs when utilizing AI models.
  Conclusion We provide further evidence of the feasibility of using commercially
  available WDs for the purpose of BGL estimation amongst diabetics.'
