abstract: Unraveled is a novel cybersecurity dataset capturing Advanced Persistent
  Threat (APT) attacks not available in the public domain. Existing cybersecurity
  datasets lack coherent information about sophisticated and persistent cyber-attack
  features, including attack planning and deployment, stealthiness of the attacker(s),
  longer dorm period between attack activities, etc. Our APT attack scenario in Unraveled
  is implemented on a real network system established on a cloud platform to emulate
  an organization’s network system. The new dataset provides a comprehensive network
  flow and host-level log information about the normal user(s) traffic and the cyber
  attacks traffic. To emulate realistic network traffic scenarios, Unraveled also
  includes attacks at different skills reflecting a typical organization’s threat
  posture, and by utilizing APT attack information from one of the well-known APT
  attack databases, i.e., MITRE’s APT-group database. Furthermore, we design and develop
  an Employee Behavior Generation (EBG) model to emulate multiple normal employees’
  traffic and activities during a 6-week time period based on their pre-defined business
  functions. Using well-known machine learning models for anomaly detection, we show
  that the APT attack activities in Unraveled are hardly detected, indicating the
  need for more effective solutions that are based on datasets representing real world
  APT attacks.
