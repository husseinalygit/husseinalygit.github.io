abstract: The one-class classification has been successfully applied in many communication,
  signal processing, and machine learning tasks. This problem, as defined by the one-class
  SVM approach, consists in identifying a sphere enclosing all (or the most) of the
  data. The classical strategy to solve the problem considers a simultaneous estimation
  of both the center and the radius of the sphere. In this paper, we study the impact
  of separating the estimation problem. It turns out that simple one-class classification
  methods can be easily derived, by considering a least-squares formulation. The proposed
  framework allows us to derive some theoretical results, such as an upper bound on
  the probability of false detection. The relevance of this work is illustrated on
  well-known datasets.
