 abstract = {Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring has been a long-standing dream in diabetes management. The use of Raman spectroscopy, with its molecular specificity, has been investigated in this regard over the past decade. Previous studies reported on glucose sensing based on indirect evidence such as statistical correlation to the reference glucose concentration. However, these claims fail to demonstrate glucose Raman peaks, which has raised questions regarding the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy for glucose sensing. Here, we demonstrate the first direct observation of glucose Raman peaks from in vivo skin. The signal intensities varied proportional to the reference glucose concentrations in three live swine glucose clamping experiments. Tracking spectral intensity based on linearity enabled accurate prospective prediction in within-subject and intersubject models. Our direct demonstration of glucose signal may quiet the long debate about whether glucose Raman spectra can be measured in vivo in transcutaneous glucose sensing.
Noninvasive optical sensor can measure blood glucose levels based on the glucose Raman signal from in vivo skin.
