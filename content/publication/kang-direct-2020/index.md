abstract: Noninvasive blood glucose monitoring has been a long-standing dream in diabetes
  management. The use of Raman spectroscopy, with its molecular specificity, has been
  investigated in this regard over the past decade. Previous studies reported on glucose
  sensing based on indirect evidence such as statistical correlation to the reference
  glucose concentration. However, these claims fail to demonstrate glucose Raman peaks,
  which has raised questions regarding the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy for
  glucose sensing. Here, we demonstrate the first direct observation of glucose Raman
  peaks from in vivo skin. The signal intensities varied proportional to the reference
  glucose concentrations in three live swine glucose clamping experiments. Tracking
  spectral intensity based on linearity enabled accurate prospective prediction in
  within-subject and intersubject models. Our direct demonstration of glucose signal
  may quiet the long debate about whether glucose Raman spectra can be measured in
  vivo in transcutaneous glucose sensing. Noninvasive optical sensor can measure blood
  glucose levels based on the glucose Raman signal from in vivo skin. Noninvasive
  optical sensor can measure blood glucose levels based on the glucose Raman signal
  from in vivo skin.
