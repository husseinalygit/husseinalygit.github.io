abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to train computers to perform
  a variety of complex tasks and improve with experience. Computers learn how to recognize
  patterns, make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic environment. Certain
  trained machines may be more effective than others because they are based on more
  suitable ML algorithms or because they were trained through superior training sets.
  Although ML algorithms are known and publicly released, training sets may not be
  reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be guarded as trade secrets. While much
  research has been performed about the privacy of the elements of training sets,
  in this paper we focus our attention on ML classifiers and on the statistical information
  that can be unconsciously or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is
  possible to infer unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular,
  we build a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining
  meaningful information about their training sets. This kind of information leakage
  can be exploited, for example, by a vendor to build more effective classifiers or
  to simply acquire trade secrets from a competitor's apparatus, potentially violating
  its intellectual property rights.
