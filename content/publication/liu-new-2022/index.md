abstract: In order to define a benchmark for Machine Learning (ML)-based Advanced
  Persistent Threat (APT) detection in the network traffic, this letter presents SCVIC-APT-2021,
  a new dataset that can realistically represent the contemporary network architecture
  and APT characteristics. Following upon this, an ML-based Attack Centric Method
  (ACM) is introduced to evaluate the APT detection performance on the generated dataset.
  Furthermore, ACM has been shown to outperform the baseline approaches with a maximum
  macro average F1 score of 82.27% corresponding to 9.4% improvement with respect
  to the baseline performance.
