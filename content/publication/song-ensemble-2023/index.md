abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) often consume large amounts of energy, and uncoordinated
  charging of many EVs may lead to grid overload, adversely impacting other customers.
  Electricity distributors require full visibility on the EV distribution to better
  manage operation planning of their distribution grid. However, they often have incomplete
  knowledge of EV presence in their network. Identifying EV customers (charging at
  home) using smart meter data is a nontrivial task for the grid network and energy
  scheduling. The difficulties include recognizing charging patterns, balancing the
  number of EV and non-EV customers during modeling, and building an efficient classification
  model. In this article, we propose a periodic pattern recognition method to extract
  useful EV charging patterns. Real world smart meter datasets are unbalanced with
  few EVs and majority of energy customers are those without EVs. We improve Kmedoids
  evaluated by dynamic time warping to obtain the representative non-EV training samples
  so that balanced samples over EV and non-EV customers can be obtained. We develop
  an ensemble classification model (ECM) by taking advantages of multiple classifiers,
  in which the optimization consists of obtaining the optimal subset of periodic patterns
  and the optimal parameters in each classifier and the optimal weights for combining
  classifiers. The superiority of the proposed ECM is demonstrated in comparison to
  several baseline models.
