abstract: The smart grid is enabling the collection of massive amounts of high-dimensional
  and multi-type data about the electric power grid operations, by integrating advanced
  metering infrastructure, control technologies, and communication technologies. However,
  the traditional modeling, optimization, and control technologies have many limitations
  in processing the data; thus, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
  in the smart grid are becoming more apparent. This survey presents a structured
  review of the existing research into some common AI techniques applied to load forecasting,
  power grid stability assessment, faults detection, and security problems in the
  smart grid and power systems. It also provides further research challenges for applying
  AI technologies to realize truly smart grid systems. Finally, this survey presents
  opportunities of applying AI to smart grid problems. The paper concludes that the
  applications of AI techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience
  of smart grid systems.
