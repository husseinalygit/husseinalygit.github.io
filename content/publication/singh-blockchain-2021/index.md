abstract: In recent years, rapid advancements in smart grid technology and smart metering
  systems have raised serious privacy concerns about the collection of customersâ€™
  real-time energy usage behaviors. Due to cybersecurity attacks and threats, data
  aggregation operations in a smart grid are challenging. The majority of existing
  techniques have high computation and communication costs and are still vulnerable
  to various security and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a deep learning and
  homomorphic encryption-based privacy-preserving data aggregation model to mitigate
  the negative impact of a flash workload on the accuracy of prediction models. The
  model also ensures a secure data aggregation process with low computational overhead.
  The proposed model is 80% more effective than the traditional approach in detecting
  smart meter manipulation, and the computation cost is 20% to 80% less than existing
  techniques. Thus, the proposed blockchain and homomorphic encryption-based data
  aggregation (BHDA) scheme shows a significant improvement in performance and privacy
  preservation with minimal computation overhead for data aggregation in smart grids.
