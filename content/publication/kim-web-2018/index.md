abstract: Web traffic refers to the amount of data that is sent and received by people
  visiting online websites. Web traffic anomalies represent abnormal changes in time
  series traffic, and it is important to perform detection quickly and accurately
  for the efficient operation of complex computer networks systems. In this paper,
  we propose a C-LSTM neural network for effectively modeling the spatial and temporal
  information contained in traffic data, which is a one-dimensional time series signal.
  We also provide a method for automatically extracting robust features of spatial-temporal
  information from raw data. Experiments demonstrate that our C-LSTM method can extract
  more complex features by combining a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term
  memory (LSTM), and deep neural network (DNN). The CNN layer is used to reduce the
  frequency variation in spatial information; the LSTM layer is suitable for modeling
  time information; and the DNN layer is used to map data into a more separable space.
  Our C-LSTM method also achieves nearly perfect anomaly detection performance for
  web traffic data, even for very similar signals that were previously considered
  to be very difficult to classify. Finally, the C-LSTM method outperforms other state-of-the-art
  machine learning techniques on Yahoo's well-known Webscope S5 dataset, achieving
  an overall accuracy of 98.6% and recall of 89.7% on the test dataset.
