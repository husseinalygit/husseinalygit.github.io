abstract: Microscopic traffic simulation is an invaluable tool for traffic research.
  In recent years, both the scope of research and the capabilities of the tools have
  been extended considerably. This article presents the latest developments concerning
  intermodal traffic solutions, simulator coupling and model development and validation
  on the example of the open source traffic simulator SUMO.
