abstract: Industries, people's activities and urban infrastructure rely more and more
  on \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) devices for all kinds of activities and operations.
  Although securing a computer network has always been a difficult task, it transmutes
  into a massive challenge with the exponentially-growing network size and heterogenity
  in these systems. A recent example in that vein is a major security violation in
  the form of DDoS attacks which were performed by a huge number of IoT devices infected
  with a botnet called \"Mirai\". Moreover, the role of these devices as control,
  sensing and communication substrate in critical infrastructures aggravate such problems.
  Nevertheless, there are some new networking concepts and technologies which promise
  to offer remedies for the aforementioned challenges; one is software-defined networking
  (SDN) and another one is fog computing, which primarily provide global network control
  and local services, respectively. In this paper, we introduce a edge-oriented detection/mitigation
  scheme against DDoS in IoT using SDN and Fog approaches while utilizing Mirai as
  the case study.
