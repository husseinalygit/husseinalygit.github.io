abstract: The field of electric vehicle charging load modelling has been growing rapidly
  in the last decade. In light of the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to keep encouraging
  better modelling techniques for successful electric vehicle adoption. Additionally,
  numerous papers highlight the lack of charging station data available in order to
  build models that are consistent with reality. In this context, the purpose of this
  article is threefold. First, to provide the reader with an overview of the open
  datasets available and ready to be used in order to foster reproducible research
  in the field. Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their
  strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed
  to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in
  the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded
  around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load.
  These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time
  charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles. The models
  reviewed range from statistical characterization to stochastic processes and machine
  learning and the context of their application is assessed.
