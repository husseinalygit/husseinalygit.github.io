abstract: This paper proposes a non invasive blood glucose sensing system using photoplethysmography
  (PPG). Neural network based adaptive noise cancellation (adaline) is employed to
  reduce the motion artifact. Also artificial neural network is used to create the
  predictive model which estimates the glucose levels based on PPG signals. Error
  in estimating glucose levels came out to be 5.48 mg/dl using ANN on MATLAB. This
  predictive model created by ANN has been implemented on FPGA. Error in estimating
  glucose levels by the ANN model implemented on FPGA, came out to be 7.23mg/dl. The
  results have been validated by performing Clarke error grid analysis.
