abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which
  resource-constrained objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range
  of technologies. The insecure nature of the Internet and wireless sensor networks,
  that are the main components of IoT, make IoT vulnerable to different attacks, especially
  routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection
  framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based
  intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT
  called sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based
  intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior
  of their host nodes and send their local results to the root node through normal
  data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection agent, that is located
  in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting
  clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on
  the MapReduce architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering
  models and consequently parallel detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach.
  The proposed method makes decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism.
  Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The deployment
  of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing
  platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious
  nodes are two key features of the proposed framework that are evaluated through
  different experiments in this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios
  showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19%
  and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks
  were launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02%
  and 2.08%, respectively.
