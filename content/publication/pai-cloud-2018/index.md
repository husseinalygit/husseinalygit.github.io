abstract: Near infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy is utilized for the development
  of a continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring system for diabetics. A portable
  embedded system for taking photoacoustic measurements on tissues to estimate glucose
  concentration is implemented using field programmable gate array (FPGA). The back-end
  architecture for high-speed data acquisition and de-noising of photoacoustic measurements
  operates at 274.823 MHz on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. The glucose measurement
  technique is verified in vitro on glucose solutions and in vivo on tissues, with
  photoacoustic signal amplitude varying linearly with sample glucose concentration.
  A kernel-based regression algorithm using multiple features of the photoacoustic
  signal is used to estimate glucose concentration from photoacoustic measurements.
  The calibration algorithm provides a superior performance over previous efforts
  with a mean absolute relative difference of 8.84% and Clarke Error Grid distribution
  of 92.86% and 7.14% over Zones A and B of the grid. A cloud computing platform for
  automated monitoring of blood glucose levels is proposed to enable individuals with
  diabetes to connect with doctors and caretakers. The developed system is connected
  to the cloud service using a mobile device, which facilitates implementation of
  computationally intensive calibration tasks and the storage and analysis of measurement
  data for treatment and monitoring.
