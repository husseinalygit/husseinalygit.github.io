abstract: 'Outlier detection is a statistical procedure that aims to find suspicious
  events or items that are different from the normal form of a dataset. It has drawn
  considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier
  detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit
  card transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general types of
  outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall outside the normal range
  for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers may fall within the normal range for
  the entire dataset, but outside the normal range for the surrounding data points.
  This paper addresses local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local
  outlier detection is the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), a density-based technique.
  There are many LOF algorithms for a static data environment; however, these algorithms
  cannot be applied directly to data streams, which are an important type of big data.
  In general, local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still deficient
  and better algorithms need to be developed that can effectively analyze the high
  velocity of data streams to detect local outliers. This paper presents a literature
  review of local outlier detection algorithms in static and stream environments,
  with an emphasis on LOF algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local outlier
  detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. Furthermore, the paper
  discusses the advantages and limitations of those algorithms and proposes several
  promising directions for developing improved local outlier detection methods for
  data streams.'
