abstract: The utilization of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals for biometric identification
  represents a novel approach in the area of secure authentication. PPG signals can
  be easily obtained with low cost and have great potential to serve as biometric
  identification mechanism. This paper explores the feasibility, along with the relevant
  signal processing methods, of using PPG signals of an individual as a biometric
  trait. PPG signals from two biometric datasets are examined. PPG signals were obtained
  from the fingertips of 29 healthy subjects. The experimental results demonstrate
  that PPG signals can be used as bio-measures for identification purposes given that
  PPG signals are collected under controlled environment and with accurate sensors.
