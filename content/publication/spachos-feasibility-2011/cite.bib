 abstract = {The utilization of photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals for biometric identification represents a novel approach in the area of secure authentication. PPG signals can be easily obtained with low cost and have great potential to serve as biometric identification mechanism. This paper explores the feasibility, along with the relevant signal processing methods, of using PPG signals of an individual as a biometric trait. PPG signals from two biometric datasets are examined. PPG signals were obtained from the fingertips of 29 healthy subjects. The experimental results demonstrate that PPG signals can be used as bio-measures for identification purposes given that PPG signals are collected under controlled environment and with accurate sensors.},
