abstract: "Background: The Control to Range Study was a multinational artificial pancreas
  study designed to assess the time spent in the hypo- and hyperglycemic ranges in
  adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes while under closed-loop control. The
  controller attempted to keep the glucose ranges between 70 and 180 mg/dL. A set
  of prespecified metrics was used to measure safety.Research Design and Methods:
  We studied 53 individuals for approximately 22 h each during clinical research center
  admissions. Plasma glucose level was measured every 15–30 min (YSI clinical laboratory
  analyzer instrument [YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH]). During the admission, subjects
  received three mixed meals (1 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight; 100 g maximum)
  with meal announcement and automated insulin dosing by the controller.Results: For
  adults, the mean of subjects' mean glucose levels was 159 mg/dL, and mean percentage
  of values 71–180 mg/dL was 66% overall (59% daytime and 82% overnight). For adolescents,
  the mean of subjects' mean glucose levels was 166 mg/dL, and mean percentage of
  values in range was 62% overall (53% daytime and 82% overnight). Whereas prespecified
  criteria for safety were satisfied by both groups, they were met at the individual
  level in adults only for combined daytime/nighttime and for isolated nighttime.
  Two adults and six adolescents failed to meet the daytime criterion, largely because
  of postmeal hyperglycemia, and another adolescent failed to meet the nighttime criterion.Conclusions:
  The control-to-range system performed as expected: faring better overnight than
  during the day and performing with variability between patients even after individualization
  based on patients' prior settings. The system had difficulty preventing postmeal
  excursions above target range."
