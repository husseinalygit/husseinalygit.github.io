abstract: '(1) Background: the use of machine learning techniques for the purpose
  of anticipating hypoglycemia has increased considerably in the past few years. Hypoglycemia
  is the drop in blood glucose below critical levels in diabetic patients. This may
  cause loss of cognitive ability, seizures, and in extreme cases, death. In almost
  half of all the severe cases, hypoglycemia arrives unannounced and is essentially
  asymptomatic. The inability of a diabetic patient to anticipate and intervene the
  occurrence of a hypoglycemic event often results in crisis. Hence, the prediction
  of hypoglycemia is a vital step in improving the life quality of a diabetic patient.
  The objective of this paper is to review work performed in the domain of hypoglycemia
  prediction by using machine learning and also to explore the latest trends and challenges
  that the researchers face in this area; (2) Methods: literature obtained from PubMed
  and Google Scholar was reviewed. Manuscripts from the last five years were searched
  for this purpose. A total of 903 papers were initially selected of which 57 papers
  were eventually shortlisted for detailed review; (3) Results: a thorough dissection
  of the shortlisted manuscripts provided an interesting split between the works based
  on two categories: hypoglycemia prediction and hypoglycemia detection. The entire
  review was carried out keeping this categorical distinction in perspective while
  providing a thorough overview of the machine learning approaches used to anticipate
  hypoglycemia, the type of training data, and the prediction horizon.'
