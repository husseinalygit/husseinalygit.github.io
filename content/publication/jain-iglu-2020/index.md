abstract: In the case of diabetes, fingertip pricking for blood sample is inconvenient
  for glucose measurement. Invasive approaches like laboratory tests and one touch
  glucometers enhance the risk of blood related infections. To mitigate this important
  issue, this article introduces a novel Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) enabled
  edge-device for precise, noninvasive blood glucose measurement. The device called
  “Intelligent Glucose Meter” (i.e., iGLU) is based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
  and a machine learning model of high accuracy. iGLU has been validated in a hospital
  and blood glucose values are stored in an IoMT platform for remote monitoring by
  endocrinologists.
