abstract: Each year, thousands of roughly 150-page parole hearing transcripts in California
  go unread because legal experts lack the time to review them. Yet, reviewing transcripts
  is the only means of public oversight in the parole process. To assist reviewers,
  we present a simple unsupervised technique for using language models (LMs) to identify
  procedural anomalies in long-form legal text. Our technique highlights unusual passages
  that suggest further review could be necessary. We utilize a contrastive perplexity
  score to identify passages, defined as the scaled difference between its perplexities
  from two LMs, one fine-tuned on the target (parole) domain, and another pre-trained
  on out-of-domain text to normalize for grammatical or syntactic anomalies. We present
  quantitative analysis of the results and note that our method has identified some
  important cases for review. We are also excited about potential applications in
  unsupervised anomaly detection, and present a brief analysis of results for detecting
  fake TripAdvisor reviews.
