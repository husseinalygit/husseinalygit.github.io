abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning and blockchain-based energy
  framework for smart grids, entitled DeepCoin. The DeepCoin framework uses two schemes,
  a blockchain-based scheme and a deep learning-based scheme. The blockchain-based
  scheme consists of five phases: setup phase, agreement phase, creating a block phase
  and consensus-making phase, and view change phase. It incorporates a novel reliable
  peer-to-peer energy system that is based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance
  algorithm and it achieves high throughput. In order to prevent smart grid attacks,
  the proposed framework makes the generation of blocks using short signatures and
  hash functions. The proposed deep learning-based scheme is an intrusion detection
  system (IDS), which employs recurrent neural networks for detecting network attacks
  and fraudulent transactions in the blockchain-based energy network. We study the
  performance of the proposed IDS on three different sources the CICIDS2017 dataset,
  a power system dataset, and a web robot (Bot)-Internet of Things (IoT) dataset.'
