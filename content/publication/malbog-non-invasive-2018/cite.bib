 abstract = {This study helps in monitoring blood glucose level of a patient with the aid of an android device non-invasively. Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by high level of sugar in the blood, and considered as the fastest growing long-term disease affecting millions of people globally. The study measures the blood glucose level using sensor patch through diffused reflectance spectra on the inner side of the forearm. The Arduino microcontroller does the processing of the information from the sensor patch while the Bluetooth module wirelessly transmits to the android device the measured glucose level for storing, interpreting and displaying. Results showed that there is no significant between the measured values using the commercially available glucose meter and the created device. Based on ISO 15197 standard 39 of the 40 trials conducted, or 97.5% fell within the acceptable range.},
