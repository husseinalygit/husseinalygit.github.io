abstract: This study helps in monitoring blood glucose level of a patient with the
  aid of an android device non-invasively. Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized
  by high level of sugar in the blood, and considered as the fastest growing long-term
  disease affecting millions of people globally. The study measures the blood glucose
  level using sensor patch through diffused reflectance spectra on the inner side
  of the forearm. The Arduino microcontroller does the processing of the information
  from the sensor patch while the Bluetooth module wirelessly transmits to the android
  device the measured glucose level for storing, interpreting and displaying. Results
  showed that there is no significant between the measured values using the commercially
  available glucose meter and the created device. Based on ISO 15197 standard 39 of
  the 40 trials conducted, or 97.5% fell within the acceptable range.
