abstract: 'Electricity theft is harmful to power grids. Integrating information flows
  with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft
  owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data
  analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because
  of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the
  existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of
  them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed
  to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally
  propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional
  neural networks (CNN) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and
  deep CNN model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep CNN component.
  The deep CNN component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity
  theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption
  data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity
  consumption data. As a result, wide and deep CNN model can achieve the excellent
  performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic
  dataset show that wide and deep CNN model outperforms other existing methods.'
