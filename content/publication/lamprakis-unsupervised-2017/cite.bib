 abstract = {HTTP is the main protocol used by attackers to establish a command and control (C&C) channel to infected hosts in a network. Identifying such C&C channels in network traffic is however a challenge because of the large volume and complex structure of benign HTTP requests emerging from regular user browsing activities. A common approach to C&C channel detection has been to use supervised learning techniques which are trained on old malware samples. However, these techniques require large training datasets which are generally not available in the case of advanced persistent threats (APT); APT malware are often custom-built and used against selected targets only, making it difficult to collect malware artifacts for supervised machine learning and thus rendering supervised approaches ineffective at detecting APT traffic.},
