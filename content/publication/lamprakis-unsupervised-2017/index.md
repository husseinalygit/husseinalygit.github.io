abstract: HTTP is the main protocol used by attackers to establish a command and control
  (C&C) channel to infected hosts in a network. Identifying such C&C channels in network
  traffic is however a challenge because of the large volume and complex structure
  of benign HTTP requests emerging from regular user browsing activities. A common
  approach to C&C channel detection has been to use supervised learning techniques
  which are trained on old malware samples. However, these techniques require large
  training datasets which are generally not available in the case of advanced persistent
  threats (APT); APT malware are often custom-built and used against selected targets
  only, making it difficult to collect malware artifacts for supervised machine learning
  and thus rendering supervised approaches ineffective at detecting APT traffic.
