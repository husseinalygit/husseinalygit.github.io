abstract: Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) is a fundamental instrument in the efficient
  operational management and planning of electric utilities. Emerging smart grid technologies
  pose new challenges and opportunities. Although load forecasting at the aggregate
  level has been extensively studied, electrical load forecasting at fine-grained
  geographical scales of households is more challenging. Among existing approaches,
  semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAM) have been increasingly popular
  due to their accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. Their applicability is
  justified when forecasting is addressed at higher levels of aggregation, since the
  aggregated load pattern contains relatively smooth additive components. High resolution
  data are highly volatile, forecasting the average load using GAM models with smooth
  components does not provide meaningful information about the future demand. Instead,
  we need to incorporate irregular and volatile effects to enhance the forecast accuracy.
  We focus on the analysis of such hybrid additive models applied on smart meters
  data and show that it leads to improvement of the forecasting performances of classical
  additive models at low aggregation levels.
