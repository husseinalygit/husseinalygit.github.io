abstract: 'Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting
  for 17.3 million deaths per year. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive
  technique widely used for the detection of cardiac diseases. To increase diagnostic
  sensitivity, ECG is acquired during exercise stress tests or in an ambulatory way.
  Under these acquisition conditions, the ECG is strongly affected by some types of
  noise, mainly by baseline wander (BLW). In this work were implemented nine methods
  widely used for the elimination of BLW, which are: interpolation using cubic splines,
  FIR filter, IIR filter, least mean square adaptive filtering, moving-average filter,
  independent component analysis, interpolation and successive subtraction of median
  values in RR interval, empirical mode decomposition and wavelet filtering. For the
  quantitative evaluation, the following similarity metrics were used: absolute maximum
  distance, the sum of squares of distances and percentage root-mean-square difference.
  Several experiments were performed using synthetic ECG signals generated by ECGSYM
  software, real ECG signals from QT Database, artificial BLW generated by software
  and real BLW from the Noise Stress Test Database. The best results were obtained
  by the method based on FIR high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.67 Hz.'
