abstract: Cost-friendly differential privacy (CDP) of smart meters can be preserved
  by an appropriate charging and discharging mechanism that uses rechargeable batteries
  (RBs) to generate Laplace distributed random noise. However, the existing CDP methods
  have several issues. First, the maximum discharge rate of an RB requires to vary
  with the maximal consumption of houses. Second, the probability of an RB to charge/discharge
  depends on the demand, regardless of the state-of-charge (SoC) of an RB. Third,
  in extreme SoC (near-empty or almost fully charged) of an RB, no noise added to
  the demand. To overcome these, we propose a mechanism in which a novel probability
  density function is designed to generate near Laplace distributed random noise.
  We also utilize a renewable energy source with small storage in cascade with an
  RB to enhance performance. Both theoretical analysis and simulations are performed
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
