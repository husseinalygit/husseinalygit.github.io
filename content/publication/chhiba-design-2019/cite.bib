 abstract = {In just a few years, diabetes has become an epidemic affecting 422 million people in world. This disease, with which one learns to live throughout one's life, is still frightened today. However, a properly supported diabetic can successfully live with his illness. This work involves the design of a device that allows the measurement of blood glucose in a non-invasive way from saliva. A device consisting of three stages, (sensors, amplifiers, filters), as well as a data acquisition process on the Arduino board and a transmission of these by a Bluetooth module, which will lead us to the implementation of our remote monitoring solution for diabetes, including the Android application performed in order to properly manage this disease and have an ongoing relationship with the attending physician to facilitate diagnosis.},
