abstract: In just a few years, diabetes has become an epidemic affecting 422 million
  people in world. This disease, with which one learns to live throughout one's life,
  is still frightened today. However, a properly supported diabetic can successfully
  live with his illness. This work involves the design of a device that allows the
  measurement of blood glucose in a non-invasive way from saliva. A device consisting
  of three stages, (sensors, amplifiers, filters), as well as a data acquisition process
  on the Arduino board and a transmission of these by a Bluetooth module, which will
  lead us to the implementation of our remote monitoring solution for diabetes, including
  the Android application performed in order to properly manage this disease and have
  an ongoing relationship with the attending physician to facilitate diagnosis.
