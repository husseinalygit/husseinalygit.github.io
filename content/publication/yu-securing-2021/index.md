abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a physical information system
  developed based on traditional industrial control networks. As one of the most critical
  infrastructure systems, IIoT is also a preferred target for adversaries engaged
  in advanced persistent threats (APTs). To address this issue, we explore a deep-learning-based
  proactive APT detection scheme in IIoT. In this scheme, considering the characteristics
  of long attack sequences and long-term continuous APT attacks, our solution adopts
  a well-known deep learning model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
  (BERT), to detect APT attack sequences. The APT attack sequence is also optimized
  to ensure the model's long-term sequence judgment effectiveness. The experimental
  results not only show that the proposed deep learning method has feasibility and
  effectiveness for APT detection, but also certify that the BERT model has better
  accuracy and a lower false alarm rate when detecting APT attack sequences than other
  time series models.
