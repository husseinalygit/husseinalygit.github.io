abstract: A great deal of attention has been given to deep learning over the past
  several years, and new deep learning techniques are emerging with improved functionality.
  Many computer and network applications actively utilize such deep learning algorithms
  and report enhanced performance through them. In this study, we present an overview
  of deep learning methodologies, including restricted Bolzmann machine-based deep
  belief network, deep neural network, and recurrent neural network, as well as the
  machine learning techniques relevant to network anomaly detection. In addition,
  this article introduces the latest work that employed deep learning techniques with
  the focus on network anomaly detection through the extensive literature survey.
  We also discuss our local experiments showing the feasibility of the deep learning
  approach to network traffic analysis.
