abstract: The current rapid development and large number of applications of electric
  vehicles make it necessary to further strengthen the research on the state sensing
  and demand responsiveness of electric vehicles for residential measurements. Based
  on the non-intrusive load monitoring technology and deep learning algorithm, the
  user’s power data is processed to obtain the start and end time of possible EV charging
  behavior, and then the user’s power magnitude data and the obtained possible charging
  start and end time data are used as the input data of BP neural network to identify
  the EV charging behavior and establish the load sensing model of residential EVs.
  Based on the load perception model of electric vehicles, we identify the electric
  load data of residential measurement, obtain the charging status information such
  as power and electricity of electric vehicles of users, and use the status information
  as the data base to evaluate the demand response capability of residential measurement
  electric vehicles. Finally, the simulation modeling of the above method shows that
  the method can identify the charging status of electric vehicles more accurately
  and effectively evaluate the ability of residential measurement electric vehicles
  to participate in demand response.
