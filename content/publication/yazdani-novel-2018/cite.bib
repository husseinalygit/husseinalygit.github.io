 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fast novel nonlinear filtering method named Relative-Energy (Rel-En), for robust short-term event extraction from biomedical signals. We developed an algorithm that extracts short- and long-term energies in a signal and provides a coefficient vector with which the signal is multiplied, heightening events of interest. This algorithm is thoroughly assessed on benchmark datasets in three different biomedical applications, namely ECG QRS-complex detection, EEG K-complex detection, and imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) peak detection. Rel-En successfully identified the events in these settings. Compared to the state-of-the-art, better or comparable results were obtained on QRS-complex and K-complex detection. For iPPG peak detection, the proposed method was used as a preprocessing step to a fixed threshold algorithm that lead to a significant improvement in overall results. While easily defined and computed, Rel-En robustly extracted short-term events of interest. The proposed algorithm can be implemented by two filters and its parameters can be selected easily and intuitively. Furthermore, Rel-En algorithm can be used in other biomedical signal processing applications where a need of short-term event extraction is present.},
