abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast novel nonlinear filtering method named
  Relative-Energy (Rel-En), for robust short-term event extraction from biomedical
  signals. We developed an algorithm that extracts short- and long-term energies in
  a signal and provides a coefficient vector with which the signal is multiplied,
  heightening events of interest. This algorithm is thoroughly assessed on benchmark
  datasets in three different biomedical applications, namely ECG QRS-complex detection,
  EEG K-complex detection, and imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) peak detection.
  Rel-En successfully identified the events in these settings. Compared to the state-of-the-art,
  better or comparable results were obtained on QRS-complex and K-complex detection.
  For iPPG peak detection, the proposed method was used as a preprocessing step to
  a fixed threshold algorithm that lead to a significant improvement in overall results.
  While easily defined and computed, Rel-En robustly extracted short-term events of
  interest. The proposed algorithm can be implemented by two filters and its parameters
  can be selected easily and intuitively. Furthermore, Rel-En algorithm can be used
  in other biomedical signal processing applications where a need of short-term event
  extraction is present.
