 abstract = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time (PTT). Although it is proven that PTT has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from PTT, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol.},
