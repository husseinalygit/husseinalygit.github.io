abstract: In recent years, we witnessed great progress in different tasks of natural
  language understanding using machine learning. Question answering is one of these
  tasks which is used by search engines and social media platforms for improved user
  experience. Arabic is the language of the Holy Qur'an; the sacred text for 1.8 billion
  people across the world. Arabic is a challenging language for Natural Language Processing
  (NLP) due to its complex structures. In this article, we describe our attempts at
  OSACT5 Qur'an QA 2022 Shared Task, which is a question answering challenge on the
  Holy Qur'an in Arabic. We propose an ensemble learning model based on Arabic variants
  of BERT models. In addition, we perform post-processing to enhance the model predictions.
  Our system achieves a Partial Reciprocal Rank (pRR) score of 56.6% on the official
  test set.
