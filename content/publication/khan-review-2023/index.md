abstract: Class imbalance (CI) in classification problems arises when the number of
  observations belonging to one class is lower than the other. Ensemble learning combines
  multiple models to obtain a robust model and has been prominently used with data
  augmentation methods to address class imbalance problems. In the last decade, a
  number of strategies have been added to enhance ensemble learning and data augmentation
  methods, along with new methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs).
  A combination of these has been applied in many studies, but the true rank of different
  combinations would require a computational review. In this paper, we present a computational
  review to evaluate data augmentation and ensemble learning methods used to address
  prominent benchmark CI problems. We present a general framework that evaluates 10
  data augmentation and 10 ensemble learning methods for CI problems. Our objective
  is to identify the most effective combination for improving classification performance
  on imbalanced datasets. The results indicate that combinations of data augmentation
  methods with ensemble learning can significantly improve classification performance
  on imbalanced datasets. Our study is vital for the development of novel models for
  handling imbalanced datasets.
