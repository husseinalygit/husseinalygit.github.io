abstract: Network traffic anomaly may indicate a possible intrusion in the network
  and therefore anomaly detection is important to detect and prevent the security
  attacks. The early research work in this area and commercially available Intrusion
  Detection Systems (IDS) are mostly signature-based. The problem of signature based
  method is that the database signature needs to be updated as new attack signatures
  become available and therefore it is not suitable for the real-time network anomaly
  detection. The recent trend in anomaly detection is based on machine learning classification
  techniques. We apply seven different machine learning techniques with information
  entropy calculation to Kyoto 2006+ data set and evaluate the performance of these
  techniques. Our findings show that, for this particular data set, most machine learning
  techniques provide higher than 90% precision, recall and accuracy. However, using
  area under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) metric, we find that Radial Basis
  Function (RBF) performs the best among the seven algorithms studied in this work.
