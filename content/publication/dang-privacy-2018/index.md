abstract: This paper introduces a practical method to determine the EV model (Car
  Make A model B) from high resolution (/1min) energy consumption data. The proposed
  method shows the importance of privacy preservation for smart meter system. The
  paper demonstrate the decision making process as solving a multiclass classification
  problem. In particular, we focus on extracting the key features of given EV charging
  profiles, and using the features as attributes to set up a Decision Tree (DT). We
  illustrate the classification problem in a 2-dimensional space and train the decision
  boundaries of the DT by labeled “dataid-EV model” data sets. We show that using
  the trained DT is efficient to predict the model of several type-unknown EVs in
  a distribution grid. The results would help in developing privacy-enhanced loads
  metering methods.
