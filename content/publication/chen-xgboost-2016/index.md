abstract: Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method.
  In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost,
  which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many
  machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse
  data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly,
  we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build
  a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond
  billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.
