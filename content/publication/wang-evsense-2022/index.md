abstract: As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) increases, large-scale residential
  EV charging will burden the power grid, posing problems for both planning and operations.
  Promptly capturing EV charging events can help mitigate this problem. However, most
  existing grid operators lack dedicated sensors for residential EV monitoring. This
  motivates non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) as a technique to gain fine-grain
  EV charging information. We present EVSense, a robust deep neural network (DNN)
  based model for non-intrusive EV charging detection. We also show how to use federated
  transfer learning (FTL) to deploy our system on resource-constrained edge devices.
  This makes EVSense a feasible solution for large-scale EV monitoring. We evaluate
  EVSense on both real-world and synthetic datasets and find that it can achieve higher
  precision and more robust charging detection compared to existing learning-based
  and rule-based approaches. We also find that, due to the use of FTL, EVSense also
  shows excellent scalability despite diversity in residential load profiles, sampling
  rates, and seasons.
