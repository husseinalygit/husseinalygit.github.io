abstract: Machine learning techniques based on neural networks are achieving remarkable
  results in a wide variety of domains. Often, the training of models requires large,
  representative datasets, which may be crowdsourced and contain sensitive information.
  The models should not expose private information in these datasets. Addressing this
  goal, we develop new algorithmic techniques for learning and a refined analysis
  of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Our implementation
  and experiments demonstrate that we can train deep neural networks with non-convex
  objectives, under a modest privacy budget, and at a manageable cost in software
  complexity, training efficiency, and model quality.
