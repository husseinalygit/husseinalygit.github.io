abstract: This paper investigates the employment of photoplethysmography (PPG) for
  user authentication systems. Time-stable and user-specific features are developed
  by stretching the signal, designing a convolutional neural network and performing
  a variation-stable approach with three score fusions. Two evaluation scenarios are
  explored, namely single-session and two-sessions. In the earlier, the training and
  testing are done solely on one session data to find the user-specific features,
  while the second scenario is performed on data from two different sessions to test
  the time permanence of the features. The verification system was tested on four
  databases achieving an accuracy of 100% for single-session and 87.3% for two-sessions
  cases. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed variation-stable
  fusion which can be extended to other biometrics. The code is available in [1].
