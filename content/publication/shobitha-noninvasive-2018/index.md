abstract: Diabetes mellitus is one of the predominant threats., hence monitoring the
  glucose levels is crucial. Clinically., it is measured using invasive blood tests.
  However., using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals it is possible to find the blood
  glucose values., non-invasively. In this paper., PPG signals are used to predict
  BGL using relevance vector machine (RVM)., a supervised learning algorithm. Additionally.,
  random forest (RF) is used to predict BGL for comparison. The BGLs obtained are
  validated using Cohen kappa statistics. RVM performs better with the kappa score
  of 0.955 with a computation time of 3.720 seconds; whereas., the kappa score of
  RF is 0.759 with computation time 1.94 minutes.
