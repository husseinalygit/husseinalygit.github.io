abstract: The smart grid employs computing and communication technologies to embed
  intelligence into the power grid and, consequently, make the grid more efficient.
  Machine learning (ML) has been applied for tasks that are important for smart grid
  operation including energy consumption and generation forecasting, anomaly detection,
  and state estimation. These ML solutions commonly require sufficient historical
  data; however, this data is often not readily available because of reasons such
  as data collection costs and concerns regarding security and privacy. This paper
  introduces a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-GAN) for generating realistic
  energy consumption data by learning from real data. Generativea adversarial networks
  (GANs) have been mostly used for image tasks (e.g., image generation, super-resolution),
  but here they are used with time series data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
  from image GANs are replaced with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) because of RNNâ€™s
  ability to capture temporal dependencies. To improve training stability and increase
  quality of generated data, Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) and Metropolis-Hastings GAN
  (MH-GAN) approaches were applied. The accuracy is further improved by adding features
  created with ARIMA and Fourier transform. Experiments demonstrate that data generated
  by R-GAN can be used for training energy forecasting models.
