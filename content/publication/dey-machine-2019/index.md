abstract: 'The combination of traditional cloud computing and mobile computing leads
  to the novel paradigm of mobile cloud computing. Due to the mobility of network
  nodes in mobile cloud computing, security has been a challenging problem of paramount
  importance. When a mobile cloud involves heterogeneous client networks, such as
  Wireless Sensor Networks and Vehicular Networks, the security problem becomes more
  challenging because the client networks often have different security requirements
  in terms of computational complexity, power consumption, and security levels. To
  securely collect and fuse the data from heterogeneous client networks in complex
  systems of this kind, novel security schemes need to be devised. Intrusion detection
  is one of the key security functions in mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client
  networks. A variety of different rule-based intrusion detection methods could be
  employed in this type of systems. However, the existing intrusion detection schemes
  lead to high computation complexity or require frequent rule updates, which seriously
  harms their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based intrusion
  detection scheme for mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client networks. The
  proposed scheme does not require rule updates and its complexity can be customized
  to suit the requirements of the client networks. Technically, the proposed scheme
  includes two steps: multi-layer traffic screening and decision-based Virtual Machine
  (VM) selection. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme is highly
  effective in terms of intrusion detection.'
