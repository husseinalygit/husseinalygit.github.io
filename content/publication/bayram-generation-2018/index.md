abstract: Qatar is known to be one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world,
  yet very little is known about its electricity consumption patterns. In this paper,
  we unfold the electricity sector in Qatar by presenting high-resolution electricity
  load profiles, analyzing the unique consumption patterns, and with case studies,
  showing how load profiles can be used in applications such as demand-side management,
  renewable energy integration, and mathematical modeling. Moreover, using load profiles,
  we propose a methodology to estimate the cooling demand which represents the largest
  portion of the domestic demand. The data used in this study is collected from the
  official website of the Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (GCCIA),
  validated by the available public datasets, and span a 12 month period from February
  2016 to January 2017. The present paper contains the first high-resolution dataset
  in the GCC region and the results will shed light into future research studies.
