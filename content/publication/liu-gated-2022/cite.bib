 abstract = {An increasing population of electric vehicles (EVs) requests more electricity consumption to satisfy the EV charging demand. The EV charging demand should be detected and coordinated to reduces the power grid blackout risk and electricity generation cost. However, it is difficult to identify the residential EV user electricity consumption profile. In this paper, a data processing method is proposed to resample the EV charging events. Then, a multi-layer gated recurrent units (GRU) network construction is designed to train an EV user profile detection model with the resampled time series data. The proposed method is verified and tested in large-scale real-world data. The result shows the data processing method and GRU improves the EV detection model performance.},
