abstract: An increasing population of electric vehicles (EVs) requests more electricity
  consumption to satisfy the EV charging demand. The EV charging demand should be
  detected and coordinated to reduces the power grid blackout risk and electricity
  generation cost. However, it is difficult to identify the residential EV user electricity
  consumption profile. In this paper, a data processing method is proposed to resample
  the EV charging events. Then, a multi-layer gated recurrent units (GRU) network
  construction is designed to train an EV user profile detection model with the resampled
  time series data. The proposed method is verified and tested in large-scale real-world
  data. The result shows the data processing method and GRU improves the EV detection
  model performance.
