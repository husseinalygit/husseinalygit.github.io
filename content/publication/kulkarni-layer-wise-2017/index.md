abstract: Deep learning has shown promising results in many machine learning applications.
  The hierarchical feature representation built by deep networks enable compact and
  precise encoding of the data. A kernel analysis of the trained deep networks demonstrated
  that with deeper layers, more simple and more accurate data representations are
  obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for layer-wise training of a deep
  network for the supervised classification task. A transformation matrix of each
  layer is obtained by solving an optimization aimed at a better representation where
  a subsequent layer builds its representation on the top of the features produced
  by a previous layer. We compared the performance of our approach with a DNN trained
  using back-propagation which has same architecture as ours. Experimental results
  on the real image datasets demonstrate efficacy of our approach. We also performed
  kernel analysis of layer representations to validate the claim of better feature
  encoding.
