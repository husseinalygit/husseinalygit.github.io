abstract: With increasing concerns for data privacy and ownership, recent years have
  witnessed a paradigm shift in machine learning (ML). An emerging paradigm, federated
  learning (FL), has gained great attention and has become a novel design for machine
  learning implementations. FL enables the ML model training at data silos under the
  coordination of a central server, eliminating communication overhead and without
  sharing raw data. In this paper, we conduct a review of the FL paradigm and, in
  particular, compare the types, the network structures, and the global model aggregation
  methods. Then, we conducted a comprehensive review of FL applications in the energy
  domain (refer to the smart grid in this paper). We provide a thematic classification
  of FL to address a variety of energy-related problems, including demand response,
  identification, prediction, and federated optimizations. We describe the taxonomy
  in detail and conclude with a discussion of various aspects, including challenges,
  opportunities, and limitations in its energy informatics applications, such as energy
  system modeling and design, privacy, and evolution.
