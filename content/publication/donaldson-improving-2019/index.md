abstract: Selection of the most appropriate forecast model should be governed by the
  underlying data. This paper investigates the impact of benchmark model selection,
  recency effect and synthetic weather station selection techniques on load forecast
  performance and presents a new weighted average based approach to generate a synthetic
  weather station. Lessons learned from this effort include the criticality of using
  benchmark models, the need for additional public datasets, and the value of forecasting
  competitions for learning and model development. The results from this case study
  validate that addition of recency effect and use of a synthetic weather station,
  can provide substantial forecast improvements over benchmark models. The results
  also demonstrate the potential benefit of using a weighted approach for synthetic
  weather station generation rather than simple averaging.
