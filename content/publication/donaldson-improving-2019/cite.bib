 abstract = {Selection of the most appropriate forecast model should be governed by the underlying data. This paper investigates the impact of benchmark model selection, recency effect and synthetic weather station selection techniques on load forecast performance and presents a new weighted average based approach to generate a synthetic weather station. Lessons learned from this effort include the criticality of using benchmark models, the need for additional public datasets, and the value of forecasting competitions for learning and model development. The results from this case study validate that addition of recency effect and use of a synthetic weather station, can provide substantial forecast improvements over benchmark models. The results also demonstrate the potential benefit of using a weighted approach for synthetic weather station generation rather than simple averaging.},
