abstract: 'Background/Aim: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has revealed that glycemic
  variability (GV) and low time in range (TIR) are associated with albuminuria and
  retinopathy. We have investigated the relationship between CGM metrics and highly
  sensitive markers of nerve pathology using corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) in
  participants with type 1 and type-2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 40 participants
  with diabetes and 28 healthy controls underwent quantification of corneal nerve
  fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length
  (CNFL) and inferior whorl length (IWL). Participants with diabetes underwent CGM
  for 4 consecutive days. Results: CNBD was significantly lower in patients with high
  GV compared to low GV median (range) (25.0(19.0-37.5) vs. 38.6(29.2-46.9); P=0.007);
  in patients who spent textgreater4% compared to textless4% time below range (54-69
  mg/dl) (25.0(22.9-37.5) vs. 37.5(29.2-46.9); P=0.045) and in patients who spent
  textgreater1% compared to textless1% time in severe hypoglycemia (textless54 mg/dl)
  (25.0 (19.8-41.7) vs. 35.4 (28.1-44.8); P=0.04). Duration in hyperglycemia and severe
  hyperglycemia did not correlate with CNFD (Ptextgreater0.05), CNBD (Ptextgreater0.05),
  CNFL (Ptextgreater0.05) or IWL (Ptextgreater0.05), but duration in hypoglycemia
  correlated with CNBD (r=-0.342, P=0.031). Conclusions: Greater glucose variability
  and duration in hypoglycemia, rather than hyperglycemia are associated with nerve
  fiber loss in diabetes.'
