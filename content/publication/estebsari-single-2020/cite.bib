 abstract = {The integration of more renewable energy resources into distribution networks makes the operation of these systems more challenging compared to the traditional passive networks. This is mainly due to the intermittent behavior of most renewable resources such as solar and wind generation. There are many different solutions being developed to make systems flexible such as energy storage or demand response. In the context of demand response, a key factor is to estimate the amount of load over time properly to better manage the demand side. There are many different forecasting methods, but the most accurate solutions are mainly found for the prediction of aggregated loads at the substation or building levels. However, more effective demand response from the residential side requires prediction of energy consumption at every single household level. The accuracy of forecasting loads at this level is often lower with the existing methods as the volatility of single residential loads is very high. In this paper, we present a hybrid method based on time series image encoding techniques and a convolutional neural network. The results of the forecasting of a real residential customer using different encoding techniques are compared with some other existing forecasting methods including SVM, ANN, and CNN. Without CNN, the lowest mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE) for a 15 min forecast is above 20%, while with existing CNN, directly applied to time series, an MAPE of around 18% could be achieved. We find the best image encoding technique for time series, which could result in higher accuracy of forecasting using CNN, an MAPE of around 12%.},
