abstract: The integration of more renewable energy resources into distribution networks
  makes the operation of these systems more challenging compared to the traditional
  passive networks. This is mainly due to the intermittent behavior of most renewable
  resources such as solar and wind generation. There are many different solutions
  being developed to make systems flexible such as energy storage or demand response.
  In the context of demand response, a key factor is to estimate the amount of load
  over time properly to better manage the demand side. There are many different forecasting
  methods, but the most accurate solutions are mainly found for the prediction of
  aggregated loads at the substation or building levels. However, more effective demand
  response from the residential side requires prediction of energy consumption at
  every single household level. The accuracy of forecasting loads at this level is
  often lower with the existing methods as the volatility of single residential loads
  is very high. In this paper, we present a hybrid method based on time series image
  encoding techniques and a convolutional neural network. The results of the forecasting
  of a real residential customer using different encoding techniques are compared
  with some other existing forecasting methods including SVM, ANN, and CNN. Without
  CNN, the lowest mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE) for a 15 min forecast is
  above 20%, while with existing CNN, directly applied to time series, an MAPE of
  around 18% could be achieved. We find the best image encoding technique for time
  series, which could result in higher accuracy of forecasting using CNN, an MAPE
  of around 12%.
