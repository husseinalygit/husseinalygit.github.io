abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to estimate the skin blood flow using
  infrared light. Researchers from different domains of science have become increasingly
  interested in PPG because of its advantages as non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient
  diagnostic tool. Traditionally, it measures the oxygen saturation, blood pressure,
  cardiac output, and for assessing autonomic functions. Moreover, PPG is a promising
  technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be
  helpful for regular GP-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value
  of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential
  information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention
  for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation.
  Therefore, this overview discusses different types of artifact added to PPG signal,
  characteristic features of PPG waveform, and existing indexes to evaluate for diagnoses.
