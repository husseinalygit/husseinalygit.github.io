abstract: Objective The Alertgy noninvasive continuous glucose monitor (ANICGM) is
  a novel wristband device that reports glucose levels without entailing skin puncture.
  This study evaluated the performance of the ANICGM compared to a Food and Drug Administration-approved
  glucose meter in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods The ANICGM device measures
  changes in the electromagnetic field generated by its sensor to produce a dielectric
  spectrum. The data contained within this spectrum are used in tandem with machine
  learning algorithms to estimate blood glucose levels. Values from the ANICGM were
  collected, sent to the Alertgy lab, formatted, and compared with fingerstick blood
  glucose levels, which were measured using the Accuchek Inform II glucometer. Fifteen
  patients completed three 120-minute sessions. The mean absolute relative difference
  (MARD) was calculated. Results MARD values were compared between study days 2 and
  3. The MARD for day 2 was 18.5% (95% CI, 12.8-42.2%), and the MARD for day 3 was
  15.3% (95% CI, 12.3-18.4%). The difference in the MARD between days 2 and 3 was
  not statistically significant (PÂ = .210). Conclusion The resulting MARDs suggest
  that further investigation into the use of dielectric spectroscopy for glucose monitoring
  should be explored.
