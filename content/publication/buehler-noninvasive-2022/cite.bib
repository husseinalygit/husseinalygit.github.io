The Alertgy noninvasive continuous glucose monitor (ANICGM) is a novel wristband device that reports glucose levels without entailing skin puncture. This study evaluated the performance of the ANICGM compared to a Food and Drug Administration-approved glucose meter in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
The ANICGM device measures changes in the electromagnetic field generated by its sensor to produce a dielectric spectrum. The data contained within this spectrum are used in tandem with machine learning algorithms to estimate blood glucose levels. Values from the ANICGM were collected, sent to the Alertgy lab, formatted, and compared with fingerstick blood glucose levels, which were measured using the Accuchek Inform II glucometer. Fifteen patients completed three 120-minute sessions. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was calculated.
Results
MARD values were compared between study days 2 and 3. The MARD for day 2 was 18.5% (95% CI, 12.8-42.2%), and the MARD for day 3 was 15.3% (95% CI, 12.3-18.4%). The difference in the MARD between days 2 and 3 was not statistically significant (PÂ = .210).
Conclusion
The resulting MARDs suggest that further investigation into the use of dielectric spectroscopy for glucose monitoring should be explored.},
