abstract: 'In recent years, sensors in the Internet of things have been commonly used
  in Human’s life. APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) has caused serious damage to
  network security and the sensors play an important role in the attack process. For
  a long time, attackers infiltrate, attack, conceal, spread, and steal information
  of target groups through the compound use of various attacking means, while existing
  security measures based on single-time nodes cannot defend against such attacks.
  Attackers often exploit the sensors’ vulnerabilities to attack targets because the
  security level of the sensors is relatively low when compared with that of the host.
  We can find APT attacks by checking the suspicious domains generated at different
  APT attack stages, since every APT attack has to use DNS to communicate. Although
  this method works, two challenges still exist: (1) the detection method needs to
  check a large scale of log data; (2) the small number of attacking samples limits
  conventional supervised learning. This paper proposes an APT detection framework
  AULD (Advanced Persistent Threats Unsupervised Learning Detection) to detect suspicious
  domains in APT attacks by using unsupervised learning. We extract ten important
  features from the host, domain name, and time from a large number of DNS log data.
  Later, we get the suspicious cluster by performing unsupervised learning. We put
  all of the domains in the cluster into the list of malicious domains. We collected
  1,584,225,274 DNS records from our university network. The experiments show that
  AULD detected all of the attacking samples and that AULD can effectively detect
  the suspicious domain names in APT attacks.'
