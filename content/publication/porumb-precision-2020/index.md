abstract: Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy
  subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk
  of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic
  patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific
  conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due
  to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects
  failed to deploy electrocardiogram (ECG)-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably.
  The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw
  ECG signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals,
  monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation
  method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave,
  ST-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject,
  overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance
  the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming system using
  short excerpts of ECG signal.
