abstract: The automatic analysis of respiratory sounds has been a field of great research
  interest during the last decades. Automated classification of respiratory sounds
  has the potential to detect abnormalities in the early stages of a respiratory dysfunction
  and thus enhance the effectiveness of decision making. However, the existence of
  a publically available large database, in which new algorithms can be implemented,
  evaluated, and compared, is still lacking and is vital for further developments
  in the field. In the context of the International Conference on Biomedical and Health
  Informatics (ICBHI), the first scientific challenge was organized with the main
  goal of developing algorithms able to characterize respiratory sound recordings
  derived from clinical and non-clinical environments. The database was created by
  two research teams in Portugal and in Greece, and it includes 920 recordings acquired
  from 126 subjects. A total of 6898 respiration cycles were recorded. The cycles
  were annotated by respiratory experts as including crackles, wheezes, a combination
  of them, or no adventitious respiratory sounds. The recordings were collected using
  heterogeneous equipment and their duration ranged from 10 to 90 s. The chest locations
  from which the recordings were acquired was also provided. Noise levels in some
  respiration cycles were high, which simulated real life conditions and made the
  classification process more challenging.
