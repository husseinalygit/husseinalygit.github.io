abstract: Ensembles are often expensive to evaluate since they require running multiple
  modelsâ€”each of which is costly in the case of neural networks. Using ensembles in
  compute-constrained applications would be much more practical if just a subset of
  the models could be evaluated. We address this issue with a novel product-of-experts-based
  method for early-exit ensembling. We rely on the fact that the product of finite-support
  probability distributions (e.g., the continuous uniform) has support less than or
  equal to that of the multiplicands. Thus, by setting a confidence threshold, we
  can stop evaluating ensemble members once the size of the support has been sufficiently
  reduced. We demonstrate our methodology for both realvalue regression and multi-class
  classification.
