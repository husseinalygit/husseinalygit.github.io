abstract: We propose a combined method that is based on the fuzzy time series (FTS)
  and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for short-term load forecasting (STLF).
  Accordingly, in the proposed method, multivariate time series data which include
  hourly load data, hourly temperature time series and fuzzified version of load time
  series, was converted into multi-channel images to be fed to a proposed deep learning
  CNN model with proper architecture. By using images which have been created from
  the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed CNN model could determine
  and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without
  any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following
  this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some
  traditional STLF models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference
  between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of STLF. Moreover,
  using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one
  dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of
  presenting it with exact numbers. Various experiments on test data-sets support
  the efficiency of the proposed method.
