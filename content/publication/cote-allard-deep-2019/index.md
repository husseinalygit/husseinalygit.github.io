abstract: In recent years, deep learning algorithms have become increasingly more
  prominent for their unparalleled ability to automatically learn discriminant features
  from large amounts of data. However, within the field of electromyography-based
  gesture recognition, deep learning algorithms are seldom employed as they require
  an unreasonable amount of effort from a single person, to generate tens of thousands
  of examples. This paper's hypothesis is that general, informative features can be
  learned from the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple
  users, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition. Consequently,
  this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data from multiple
  users while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms to learn discriminant
  features from large datasets. Two datasets comprised 19 and 17 able-bodied participants,
  respectively (the first one is employed for pre-training), were recorded for this
  work, using the Myo armband. A third Myo armband dataset was taken from the NinaPro
  database and is comprised ten able-bodied participants. Three different deep learning
  networks employing three different modalities as input (raw EMG, spectrograms, and
  continuous wavelet transform (CWT)) are tested on the second and third dataset.
  The proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly
  enhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving an
  offline accuracy of 98.31% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the CWT-based
  ConvNet and 68.98% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw EMG-based ConvNet.
  Finally, a use-case study employing eight able-bodied participants suggests that
  real-time feedback allows users to adapt their muscle activation strategy which
  reduces the degradation in accuracy normally experienced over time.
