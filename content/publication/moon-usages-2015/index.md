abstract: "In practice, there are two main usages of the battery in home: reducing
  electricity energy cost by utilizing time-varying electricity energy price and enhancing
  privacy by concealing the electricity energy usage pattern of appliances. By operating
  the battery such that it is charged/discharged during periods with low/high prices,
  we can reduce the electricity energy cost. On the other hand, by operating the battery
  such that the electricity usage pattern can be significantly changed from the original
  usage pattern of appliances, we can protect user's privacy. However, those two operations
  are not complement with each other and there exists a trade-off between reducing
  cost and enhancing privacy. In this paper, we study this issue. To consider both
  cost and privacy in a unified way, we first define cost metric and privacy metric
  that should be minimized. Then, we define an overall metric as a weighted sum of
  the two metrics to study the trade-off between them. We formulate and solve an optimization
  problem that aims at minimizing the overall metric. Finally, through numerical results,
  we study and discuss the usage of the battery for reducing cost and enhancing privacy."
