abstract: The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated measures taken
  by many countries to slow down the spread of the disease, has significantly affected
  all aspects of people's lives, including the global energy sector. This study aims
  to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the spatial patterns of electricity
  consumption in six socioeconomic sectors (residential (villa and flat), industrial,
  commercial, government, and productive farms) in the State of Qatar. The spatiotemporal
  patterns of electricity consumption have been assessed using various Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS) and spatial statistical modeling prior and during the
  pandemic. The results demonstrate variations in electricity consumption within and
  between the six sectors. The main changes in the electricity consumption within
  sectors during the pandemic year is during the lockdown phase. Spatially, some sectors
  are affected by the pandemic, and hence the pattern and the spatial and temporal
  distribution of electricity consumption has changed during the pandemic year compared
  to pre-pandemic years. The results also show that there were variations of spatial
  clustering of electricity consumption among these sectors. Most of the high-high
  clustering patterns are located in the mid-eastern and northeastern parts of Qatar.
  The highest variation in electricity consumption between sectors occurred in the
  productive farms due to its massive development during the pre-pandemic period and
  were not affected by the pandemic. There is a sharp decline in electricity consumption
  in both the industrial and commercial sectors during the pandemic year. Other sectors
  witnessed an increase in electricity consumption during the summer months, which
  was mainly due to travel restrictions imposed by many countries around the world.
  This analysis is vital for policymakers to detect the changes in electricity consumption
  patterns in the context of emergencies such as the pandemic.
