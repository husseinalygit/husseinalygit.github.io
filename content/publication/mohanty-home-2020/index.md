abstract: With the help of artificial intelligence and advanced metering infrastructure
  (AMI), the analysis of electric vehicle integration will play a vital role in the
  future smart grid. Because getting data from smart appliances, processing that data
  using advanced techniques to get the desired output in near real-time is going to
  be a significant advantage of the smart grid. In this paper, a machine learning
  technique called support vector machine(SVM) is used to analyze the home charge
  scheduling. With the help of user energy consumption, electric vehicle SOC information
  at different time intervals, it can predict the status of the electric vehicle,
  i.e., Idle, Grid to Vehicle(G2V), or Vehicle to Grid(V2G) with close to cent percent
  accuracy. The results show the advantage of the SVM technique for analysis of home
  charge scheduling using intermediate EV data.
