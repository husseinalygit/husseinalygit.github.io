abstract: Frequent metering of electricity consumption is crucial for demand-side
  management in smart grids. However, metered data can be processed fairly easily
  by employing well-established nonintrusive appliance load monitoring techniques
  to infer appliance usage, which reveals information about consumers’ private lives.
  Existing load shaping techniques for privacy primarily focus only on altering metered
  real power, whereas smart meters collect reactive power consumption data as well
  for various purposes. This study addresses consumer privacy preservation via load
  shaping in a demand response scheme, considering both real and reactive power. We
  build a multi-objective optimization framework that enables us to characterize the
  interplay between privacy maximization, user cost minimization, and user discomfort
  minimization objectives. Our results reveal that minimizing information leakage
  due to a single component, e.g., real power, would suffer from overlooking information
  leakage due to the other component, e.g., reactive power, causing sub-optimal decisions.
  In fact, joint shaping of real and reactive power components results in the best
  possible privacy preservation performance, which leads to more than a twofold increase
  in privacy in terms of mutual information.
