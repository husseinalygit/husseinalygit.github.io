abstract: 'Goal: Although photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
  can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) by extracting various features, the
  changes in morphological contours of both PPG and ECG signals due to various diseases
  of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological systems make the extraction
  of such features very difficult. Methods: In this work, we propose a waveform-based
  hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model
  for BP estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy
  level uses ANNs to extract necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms
  and the upper hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation
  of the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model
  is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical
  Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard.
  The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure
  (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed network, the mean absolute
  error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for SBP estimation are 1.10 and
  1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively.
  Conclusion: The performance of the proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found
  to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that
  the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their
  time domain variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner.
  Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available
  mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP estimation.'
