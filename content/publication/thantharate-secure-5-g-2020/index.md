abstract: Network Slicing will play a vital role in enabling a multitude of 5G applications,
  use cases, and services. Network slicing functions will provide an end-to-end isolation
  between slices with an ability to customize each slice based on the service demands
  (bandwidth, coverage, security, latency, reliability, etc.). Maintaining isolation
  of resources, traffic flow, and network functions between the slices is critical
  in protecting the network infrastructure system from Distributed Denial of Service
  (DDoS) attack. The 5G network demands and new feature sets to support ever-growing
  and complex business requirements have made existing approaches to network security
  inadequate. In this paper, we have developed a Neural Network based `Secure5G' Network
  Slicing model to proactively detect and eliminate threats based on incoming connections
  before they infest the 5G core network. `Secure5G' is a resilient model that quarantines
  the threats ensuring end-to-end security from device(s) to the core network, and
  to any of the external networks. Our designed model will enable the network operators
  to sell network slicing as-a-service to serve diverse services efficiently over
  a single infrastructure with high security and reliability.
