abstract: Highly accurate power demand forecasting represents one of key challenges
  of Smart Grid applications. In this setting, a large number of Smart Meters produces
  huge amounts of data that need to be processed to predict the load requested by
  the grid. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem, this often results in the
  adoption of simple aggregation strategies for the power that fail in capturing the
  relational information existing among the different types of user. A possible alternative,
  known as Cluster-based Aggregate Forecasting, consists in clustering the load profiles
  and, on top of that, building predictors of the aggregate at the cluster-level.
  In this work we explore the technique in the context of predictors based on deep
  recurrent neural networks and address the scalability issues presenting neural architectures
  adequate to process cluster-level aggregates. The proposed methods are finally evaluated
  both on a publicly available benchmark and a heterogenous dataset of Smart Meter
  data from an entire, medium-sized, Swiss town.
