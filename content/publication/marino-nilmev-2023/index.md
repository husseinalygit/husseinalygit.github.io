abstract: Due to its impact on household energy use and the adoption of renewable
  energies, the intelligent management of the power consumption of electric vehicles
  (EVs) is of great relevance. In the context of widespread clean energy adoption
  and growing environmental concerns, generating incentives through discounted rates
  for intelligent residential EV power consumption requires algorithms capable of
  measuring loads in a disaggregated manner. The deployment of smart meter networks
  offers the possibility of applying machine learning techniques to estimate EV residential
  consumption. This work presents an efficient algorithm for the Non Intrusive Load
  Monitoring (NILM) of EV consumption, which is an adaptation of a method previously
  proposed for high-powered water heaters. Its performance is compared with methods
  based on deep neural networks. Results from an actual power demand dataset are discussed,
  and a comparative analysis is carried out against billing rules based on time slots
  and historical power consumption data.
