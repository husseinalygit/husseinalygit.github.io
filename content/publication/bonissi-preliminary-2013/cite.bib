 abstract = {Recent studies in biometrics focus on one dimensional physiological signals commonly acquired in medical applications, like electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), phonocardiogram (PCG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG). In this context, an important application is in continuous authentication scenarios since physiological signals are frequently captured for long time periods in order to monitor the health status of the patients.},
