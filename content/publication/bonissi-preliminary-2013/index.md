abstract: Recent studies in biometrics focus on one dimensional physiological signals
  commonly acquired in medical applications, like electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalograms
  (EEG), phonocardiogram (PCG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG). In this context, an
  important application is in continuous authentication scenarios since physiological
  signals are frequently captured for long time periods in order to monitor the health
  status of the patients.
