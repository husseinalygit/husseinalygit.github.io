abstract: Threats that have been primarily targeting nation states and their associated
  entities have expanded the target zone to include the private and corporate sectors.
  This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), are those
  that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself
  against. While nation-sponsored APT attacks will always be marked by their sophistication,
  APT attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less
  challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques
  are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive
  to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding
  new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms
  of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single
  threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to
  perform APT, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of APT attacker(s) are
  required. Several works have been published on detecting an APT attack at one or
  two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting APT as a whole
  from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and
  fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks.
  Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that
  could be used to detect different stages of APT attacks, learning methods that need
  to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable
  for those adapting APT attackers. We also present different case studies of APT
  attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for
  fine-grained control of security of a networked system. We conclude this paper with
  different challenges in defending against APT and opportunities for further research,
  ending with a note on what we learned during our writing of this paper.
