abstract: Machine-learning (ML) enables computers to learn how to recognise patterns,
  make unintended decisions, or react to a dynamic environment. The effectiveness
  of trained machines varies because of more suitable ML algorithms or because superior
  training sets. Although ML algorithms are known and publicly released, training
  sets may not be reasonably ascertainable and, indeed, may be guarded as trade secrets.
  In this paper we focus our attention on ML classifiers and on the statistical information
  that can be unconsciously or maliciously revealed from them. We show that it is
  possible to infer unexpected but useful information from ML classifiers. In particular,
  we build a novel meta-classifier and train it to hack other classifiers, obtaining
  meaningful information about their training sets. Such information leakage can be
  exploited, for example, by a vendor to build more effective classifiers or to simply
  acquire trade secrets from a competitor's apparatus, potentially violating its intellectual
  property rights.
