abstract: Feedforward neural network prediction is the most commonly used method in
  time series prediction. In view of the low prediction accuracy of the conventional
  BPNN model when the time series data contain a certain linear relationship, this
  paper describes a neural network approach for time series prediction, that is BPNN–DIOC
  (back-propagation neural network with direct input-to-output connections). Eight
  different datasets were used to verify the validity of BPNN–DIOC model in time series
  prediction. In this paper, the BPNN was extended to four variants based on the presence
  or absence of output layer bias and input-to-output connections firstly, and the
  prediction accuracy of eight datasets are analyzed by statistic method secondly.
  Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the BPNN–DIOC has better prediction
  accuracy compared to the conventional BPNN while the output layer bias has no significant
  effect. Therefore, the input-to-output connections can significantly improve the
  prediction ability of time series.
