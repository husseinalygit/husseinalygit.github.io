abstract: This paper presents a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based continuous user authentication
  (CA) system, which especially leverages the PPG sensors in wrist-worn wearable devices
  to identify users. We explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system captured
  by the PPG sensing technology. Existing CA systems require either the dedicated
  sensing hardware or specific gestures, whereas our system does not require any users'
  interactions but only the wearable device, which has already been pervasively equipped
  with PPG sensors. Notably, we design a robust motion artifacts (MA) removal method
  to mitigate the impact of MA from wrist movements. Additionally, we explore the
  characteristic fiducial features from PPG measurements to efficiently distinguish
  the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for
  user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT). Experiments with the
  prototype of the wrist-worn PPG sensing platform and 10 participants in different
  scenarios demonstrate that our system can effectively remove MA and achieve a high
  average authentication success rate over $90%$.
