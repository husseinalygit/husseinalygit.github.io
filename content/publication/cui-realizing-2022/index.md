abstract: Driven by the efficient and personalized services and better management
  of the distribution networks, power utilities are always willing to recognize the
  household characteristics which reflect the dwelling and social-demographic characteristics
  of customers. As a key component of the distribution grid monitoring systems, smart
  meters installed at each customerâ€™s household offer a non-intrusive approach to
  predict the household characteristics. The resolution of energy consumption data
  has a great impact on prediction accuracy as fine granularity data can better characterize
  the household energy usage profile features. However, collecting high-resolution
  energy consumption data may not be feasible for power utilities due to the substantial
  cost of upgrading the existing Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This paper
  aims to propose a cost-effective framework for the accurate prediction of household
  characteristics by realizing the multifractal characteristics of residential electric
  energy consumption data recorded from smart meters. First, Multiscale Multivariate
  Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MMV-MFDFA) is performed on the energy
  consumption data to analyze the multiscale relationships of the residential energy
  usage profile and reveal the multifractal structures embedded in the energy data.
  Then, Self-Adaptive Multifractal Interpolation (SAMI) is developed to reconstruct
  quasi high-resolution energy consumption data from which distinctive features relevant
  to household characteristics are extracted by Mathematical Morphological Decomposition
  (MMD). Such features are further integrated with an advanced deep learning algorithm
  - Deep Forest (DF) for household characteristic prediction. The proposed method
  is validated using real-life smart meter data from Ireland.
