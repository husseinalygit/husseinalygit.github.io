 abstract = {The inconvenience and risk associated with the regular use of invasive blood glucose measurements has led to tremendous research in this area. This paper proposes the design of a non-invasive blood glucose estimation system using novel Mel frequency cepstral coefficients features of wristband photoplethysmogram signal and physiological parameters. A dataset from 217 participants of a hospital in Cuenca Ecuador is used to validate the proposed model. The support vector regression (SVR) and extreme gradient boost regression (XGBR) techniques are used to estimate blood glucose levels (BGL). The XGBR technique achieves the least value for the standard error of prediction (SEP), 9.78 mg/dL. Further, 5 features are selected from the feature set based on the feature importance in XGBR. The XGBR model with the reduced feature set results in further reduction of SEP value (5.53 mg/dL) with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Standard Clarke error grid analysis and Bland-Altman analysis shows that the predicted glucose values are in the clinically acceptable region. The results of the proposed model demonstrate the potential of wearable BGL monitoring technology.},
