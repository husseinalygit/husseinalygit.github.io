 abstract = {The recognition of various lung sounds recorded using electronic stethoscopes plays a significant role in the early diagnoses of respiratory diseases. To increase the accuracy of specialist evaluations, machine learning techniques have been intensely employed during the past 30 years. In the current study, a new pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed for the extraction of deep features. In the CNN architecture, an average-pooling layer and a max-pooling layer are connected in parallel in order to boost classification performance. The deep features are utilized as the input of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier using the Random Subspace Ensembles (RSE) method. The proposed method was evaluated against a challenge dataset known as ICBHI 2017. The deep features and the LDA with RSE method provided the best accuracy score when compared to other existing methods using the same dataset, improving the classification accuracy by 5.75%.},
