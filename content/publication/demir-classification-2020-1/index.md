abstract: The recognition of various lung sounds recorded using electronic stethoscopes
  plays a significant role in the early diagnoses of respiratory diseases. To increase
  the accuracy of specialist evaluations, machine learning techniques have been intensely
  employed during the past 30 years. In the current study, a new pretrained Convolutional
  Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed for the extraction of deep features. In the
  CNN architecture, an average-pooling layer and a max-pooling layer are connected
  in parallel in order to boost classification performance. The deep features are
  utilized as the input of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier using
  the Random Subspace Ensembles (RSE) method. The proposed method was evaluated against
  a challenge dataset known as ICBHI 2017. The deep features and the LDA with RSE
  method provided the best accuracy score when compared to other existing methods
  using the same dataset, improving the classification accuracy by 5.75%.
