abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring is essential for patients to avoid complications
  of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This paper presents a novel non-invasive
  continuous blood glucose monitoring system based on a single wavelength near-infrared
  (NIR) spectroscopy. The analog frontend of the system is designed with a single
  NIR LED to record the Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal from the fingertip with
  motion artifacts removal and a bias current rejection up to 20uA. The proposed digital
  backend extracts 10 discriminating features from the PPG signal to predict the blood
  glucose level using (Exponential Gaussian Process) machine learning regression.
  To realize the feature extraction on FPGA, a novel two-dimensional structure of
  256-point Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is implemented which achieves a 47% reduction
  in complex multiplications compared to the conventional Radix-2 algorithm. The performance
  of the proposed system is validated using 200 patients PPG recordings and glucose
  levels measured via a commercial glucometer. It successfully predicts the glucose
  level with a mean absolute relative difference (mARD) of 8.97%.
