abstract: Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects millions of people worldwide
  and requires regular monitoring of a patient&rsquo;s blood glucose level. Currently,
  blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet
  of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer&mdash;however, this process is
  uncomfortable for the patient. In this paper, a smartphone video-based noninvasive
  technique is proposed for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood.
  The videos are collected steadily from the tip of the subject&rsquo;s finger using
  smartphone cameras and subsequently converted into a Photoplethysmography (PPG)
  signal. A Gaussian filter is applied on top of the Asymmetric Least Square (ALS)
  method to remove high-frequency noise, optical noise, and motion interference from
  the raw PPG signal. These preprocessed signals are then used for extracting signal
  features such as systolic and diastolic peaks, the time differences between consecutive
  peaks (DelT), first derivative, and second derivative peaks. Finally, the features
  are fed into Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Square Regression
  (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models
  for the prediction of glucose level. Out of the four statistical learning techniques
  used, the PLS model, when applied to an unbiased dataset, has the lowest standard
  error of prediction (SEP) at 17.02 mg/dL.
