abstract: In the world of cryptocurrency-related malware, mining Monero (XMR) is a
  growing threat for organizations. In this paper we will explain why Monero is appealing
  for malicious actors, and how to leverage publicly available sources for hunting
  of Monero-related activities. We will heavily rely on automation and other open-source
  projects to achieve our objectives.
