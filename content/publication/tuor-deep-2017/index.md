abstract: Analysis of an organization's computer network activity is a key component
  of early detection and mitigation of insider threat, a growing concern for many
  organizations. Raw system logs are a prototypical example of streaming data that
  can quickly scale beyond the cognitive power of a human analyst. As a prospective
  filter for the human analyst, we present an online unsupervised deep learning approach
  to detect anomalous network activity from system logs in real time. Our models decompose
  anomaly scores into the contributions of individual user behavior features for increased
  interpretability to aid analysts reviewing potential cases of insider threat. Using
  the CERT Insider Threat Dataset v6.2 and threat detection recall as our performance
  metric, our novel deep and recurrent neural network models outperform Principal
  Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest based anomaly detection
  baselines. For our best model, the events labeled as insider threat activity in
  our dataset had an average anomaly score in the 95.53 percentile, demonstrating
  our approach's potential to greatly reduce analyst workloads.
