abstract: Fiducial points of photoplethysmogram (PPG), first derivative PPG (VPG),
  and second derivative PPG (APG) are essential in extracting numerous parameters
  to diagnose cardiovascular disease. However, the fiducial points were usually detected
  using complex mathematical algorithms. Inflection points from derivatives waveforms
  are not thoroughly studied, whereas they can significantly assist in peak detection.
  This study is performed to investigate the derivative waveforms of PPG and use them
  to detect the important peaks of PPG, VPG, and APG. PPGs with different morphologies
  from 43 ischemic heart disease subjects are analyzed. Inflection points of the derivative
  waveforms up to the fourth level are observed, and consistent information (derivative
  markers) is used to detect the fiducial points of PPG, VPG, and APG with proper
  sequence. Moving average filter and simple thresholding techniques are applied to
  detect the primary points in VPG and the third derivative waveform. A total of twelve
  out of twenty derivative markers are found reliable in detecting fiducial points
  of two common types of PPG. Systolic peaks are accurately detected with 99.64% sensitivity
  and 99.38% positive predictivity using the 43 IHD dataset and Complex System Laboratory
  (CSL) Pulse Oximetry Artifact Labels database. The study has introduced the fourth
  derivative PPG waveform with four main points, which are significantly valuable
  for detecting the fiducial points of PPG, VPG, and APG.
