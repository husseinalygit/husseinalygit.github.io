abstract: The clinical symptoms of prediabetes are mild and easy to overlook, but
  prediabetes may develop into diabetes if early intervention is not performed. In
  this study, a deep learning model&mdash;referred to as IGRNet&mdash;is developed
  to effectively detect and diagnose prediabetes in a non-invasive, real-time manner
  using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) lasting 5 s. After searching for an appropriate
  activation function, we compared two mainstream deep neural networks (AlexNet and
  GoogLeNet) and three traditional machine learning algorithms to verify the superiority
  of our method. The diagnostic accuracy of IGRNet is 0.781, and the area under the
  receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.777 after testing on the independent
  test set including mixed group. Furthermore, the accuracy and AUC are 0.856 and
  0.825, respectively, in the normal-weight-range test set. The experimental results
  indicate that IGRNet diagnoses prediabetes with high accuracy using ECGs, outperforming
  existing other machine learning methods; this suggests its potential for application
  in clinical practice as a non-invasive, prediabetes diagnosis technology.
