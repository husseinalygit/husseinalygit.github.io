abstract: In this paper, a novel plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) modeling approach
  is proposed for residential charging stations. This methodology can be used in the
  design of autonomous energy management systems (EMS) with the purpose of providing
  the charging schedules using minimum input measured data. The proposed method is
  composed of two main steps. In the first step, unlike other similar works, online
  PEV recognition is performed by means of an artificial neural network as a supervised
  classification method. The required feature space for classification is provided
  using the power spectral density estimation and the statistical analysis of individual
  PEVs charging current. The second step deals with the statistical modeling of the
  charging habits to facilitate the scheduling by predicting the charging demand using
  the current measurements on the grid side. In this respect, each PEV charging habit
  is modeled based on the correlation among the plug-in time, departure time, required
  energy, and weekdays using kernel density estimation. The performance of the suggested
  method is validated using real data collected from a charging station. The final
  results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology with a satisfactory
  precision. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a comparative analysis
  in terms of the recognition performance.
