 abstract = {In this paper, a novel plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) modeling approach is proposed for residential charging stations. This methodology can be used in the design of autonomous energy management systems (EMS) with the purpose of providing the charging schedules using minimum input measured data. The proposed method is composed of two main steps. In the first step, unlike other similar works, online PEV recognition is performed by means of an artificial neural network as a supervised classification method. The required feature space for classification is provided using the power spectral density estimation and the statistical analysis of individual PEVs charging current. The second step deals with the statistical modeling of the charging habits to facilitate the scheduling by predicting the charging demand using the current measurements on the grid side. In this respect, each PEV charging habit is modeled based on the correlation among the plug-in time, departure time, required energy, and weekdays using kernel density estimation. The performance of the suggested method is validated using real data collected from a charging station. The final results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology with a satisfactory precision. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a comparative analysis in terms of the recognition performance.},
