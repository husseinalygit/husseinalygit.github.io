abstract: A preliminary study into the signal quality of the Empatica's E4 portable
  photoplethysmogram device as validation for further research on using the device
  to detect the heart arrhythmia atrial fibrillation. In order to pursue this research,
  it was necessary to verify the quality of the data produced by the E4 device against
  a device currently used by clinicians to detect atrial fibrillation. This was done
  by having healthy volunteers wear both the Empatica E4 and the clinician standard
  device while following standard clinician procedure for atrial fibrillation diagnosis.
  The device was compared qualitatively against General Electric's SEER Light Extend
  Recorder holter portable electrocardiogram. The analysis was done by non-experts
  at varying academic levels. The primary reviewer's results showed similar data quality
  between both devices 85% of the time and the holter performed better 5% of the time.
