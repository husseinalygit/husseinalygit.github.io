abstract: 'The global market for smart electricity meters has grown rapidly in recent
  years and is anticipated to sustain its solid increase in the near future. By analyzing
  half-hourly meter data from over 4000 Irish households, this study seeks to examine
  the relationship between households’ attributes and their electricity demand through
  the following questions: (1) knowing a given set of household attributes, can we
  accurately classify households according to their demand volume and daily demand
  pattern and (2) can we infer some of the key households’ characteristics from their
  meter data. The attributes considered include the size, presence of kids, social
  class, employment status and the annual income of the households. A range of machine
  learning methods including tree-based algorithms, support vector machines and neural
  networks are deployed to answer these questions. The results suggest the potential
  for reasonably accurate segmentation of consumers according to their demand volume
  while the classification based on daily demand patterns were shown to be more challenging.
  For predicting household attributes, higher accuracy values are reported when predicting
  the household size, social class, and employment status. On the contrary, inferring
  the household income category and the presence of children in the household were
  shown to be more difficult.'
