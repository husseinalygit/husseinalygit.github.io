abstract: Peoples are naturally communicators but devices are not. In the Internet
  of Things (IoT) architecture, the smart devices (SDs), sensors, programs and association
  of smart objects are connected together to transfer information among them. The
  SD is designed as physical device linked with computing resources that are capable
  to connect and communicate with another SD through any medium and protocol. The
  communication among intelligent physical things is a challenging task to exchange
  information that guaranteed to reach to the destination completely in a real time
  with the same order as sending without corruption. The reliable communication between
  physical things can be built in the transmission control protocol (TCP) layers.
  In TCP layer, the reliable communication is required the error detection, correction
  and confirmation to exchange information among smart devices. In this paper, the
  author represents a framework to deal with reliability issues to enable the adoption
  of IoT devices. The results found the improvement in reliability.
