abstract: 'While methods for comparing two learning algorithms on a single data set
  have been scrutinized for quite some time already, the issue of statistical tests
  for comparisons of more algorithms on multiple data sets, which is even more essential
  to typical machine learning studies, has been all but ignored. This article reviews
  the current practice and then theoretically and empirically examines several suitable
  tests. Based on that, we recommend a set of simple, yet safe and robust non-parametric
  tests for statistical comparisons of classifiers: the Wilcoxon signed ranks test
  for comparison of two classifiers and the Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc
  tests for comparison of more classifiers over multiple data sets. Results of the
  latter can also be neatly presented with the newly introduced CD (critical difference)
  diagrams.'
