abstract: Non-enzymatic glucose sensors outperform enzymatic ones in terms of cost,
  sensitivity, stability, and operating duration. Though highly sensitive, it is still
  desirable to further improve the sensitivity of non-enzymatic glucose sensors to
  detect a trace amount of glucose in sweat and other biofluids. Among the demonstrated
  effective approaches using bimetals or 3D porous structures, the porous laser-induced
  graphene (LIG) on flexible polymers showcases good conductivity and a simple fabrication
  process for the integration of sensing materials. The uniform electroless plating
  of the nickel and gold layer on LIG electrodes demonstrates significantly enhanced
  sensitivity and a large linear range for glucose sensing. The sensor with the porous
  LIG foam exhibits a high sensitivity of 1080 μA mM−1 cm−2, whereas a further increased
  sensitivity of 3500 μA mM−1 cm−2 is obtained with LIG fibers (LIGF). Impressively,
  a large linear range (0–30 mM) can be achieved by changing the bias voltage from
  0.5 to 0.1 V due to the Au coating. Because the existing non-enzymatic glucose sensors
  are limited to use in basic solutions, their application in wearable electronics
  is elusive. In addition to the reduced requirement for the basic solution, this
  work integrates a porous encapsulating reaction cavity containing alkali solutions
  with a soft, skin-interfaced microfluidic component to provide integrated microfluidic
  non-enzymatic glucose sensors for sweat sampling and glucose sensing. The accurate
  glucose measurements from the human sweat and cell culture media showcase the practical
  utility, which opens up opportunities for the non-enzymatic glucose sensors in wearable
  electronics.
