abstract: A novel smart metering technique capable of anomaly detection was proposed
  for real-time home power management system. Smart meter data generated in real-time
  were obtained from 900 households of single apartments. To detect outliers and missing
  values in smart meter data, a deep learning model, the autoencoder, consisting of
  a graph convolutional network and bidirectional long short-term memory network,
  was applied to the smart metering technique. Power management based on the smart
  metering technique was executed by multi-objective optimization in the presence
  of a battery storage system and an electric vehicle. The results of the power management
  employing the proposed smart metering technique indicate a reduction in electricity
  cost and amount of power supplied by the grid compared to the results of power management
  without anomaly detection.
