 abstract = {A novel smart metering technique capable of anomaly detection was proposed for real-time home power management system. Smart meter data generated in real-time were obtained from 900 households of single apartments. To detect outliers and missing values in smart meter data, a deep learning model, the autoencoder, consisting of a graph convolutional network and bidirectional long short-term memory network, was applied to the smart metering technique. Power management based on the smart metering technique was executed by multi-objective optimization in the presence of a battery storage system and an electric vehicle. The results of the power management employing the proposed smart metering technique indicate a reduction in electricity cost and amount of power supplied by the grid compared to the results of power management without anomaly detection.},
