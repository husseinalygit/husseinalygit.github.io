abstract: 'Machine learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), support vector
  machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to detect fasting blood
  glucose levels (FBGL) in a mixed population of healthy and diseased individuals
  in an Indian population. The occurrence of elevated FBGL was estimated in a non-invasive
  manner from the status of an individual’s salivary electrochemical parameters such
  as pH, redox potential, conductivity and concentration of sodium, potassium and
  calcium ions. The samples were obtained from 175 randomly selected volunteers comprising
  half healthy and half diabetic patients. The models were trained using 70 % of the
  total data, and tested upon the remaining set. For each algorithm, data points were
  cross-validated by randomly shuffling them three times prior to implementing the
  model. The performance of the machine learning technique was reported in terms of
  four statistically significant parameters—accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1
  score. SVM using RBF kernel showed the best performance for classifying high FBGLs
  with approximately 85 % accuracy, 84 % precision, 85 % sensitivity and 85 % F1 score.
  This study has been approved by the ethical committee of All India Institute of
  Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India with the reference number: IEC/NP-278/01-08-2014,
  RP-29/2014.'
