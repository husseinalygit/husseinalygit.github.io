 abstract = {With users’ increasing knowledge and intellectualization, users’ abnormal electricity consumption behaviors (AECB) are becoming more prevalent. Since access to renewable energy sources leads to a volatile and intermittent electricity load, the existing artificial intelligence methods are challenging to detect the AECB of users. To quickly and accurately identify the AECB of a massive number of users, this work proposes the GoogLeResNet3 network module, which contains fully connected layers, the Inception module, and a residual module. The GoogLeResNet3 network is compared with the GoogLeNet module, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and 11 other neural networks. The results of the comparison experiments indicate that: the GoogLeResNet3 network with the highest accuracy is 335 s quicker than the second-fast network, and the accuracy is 10.57 % higher than the second-best network at least.},
