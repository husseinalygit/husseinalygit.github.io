abstract: 'With users’ increasing knowledge and intellectualization, users’ abnormal
  electricity consumption behaviors (AECB) are becoming more prevalent. Since access
  to renewable energy sources leads to a volatile and intermittent electricity load,
  the existing artificial intelligence methods are challenging to detect the AECB
  of users. To quickly and accurately identify the AECB of a massive number of users,
  this work proposes the GoogLeResNet3 network module, which contains fully connected
  layers, the Inception module, and a residual module. The GoogLeResNet3 network is
  compared with the GoogLeNet module, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and 11 other neural networks.
  The results of the comparison experiments indicate that: the GoogLeResNet3 network
  with the highest accuracy is 335 s quicker than the second-fast network, and the
  accuracy is 10.57 % higher than the second-best network at least.'
