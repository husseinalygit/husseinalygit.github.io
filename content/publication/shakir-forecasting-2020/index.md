abstract: The wide proliferation of renewable energy and deregulation of power grid
  systems require small power utilization systems to deploy intelligent methods of
  adjustment to the user power demand. To accomplish this goal, the smart power demand
  forecasting and power consumption optimization methods and algorithms need to be
  developed. For this purpose, small power utilization systems can benefit from the
  techniques developed for the smart grid in general. The present paper is devoted
  to the development of a forecasting model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  method and an optimization model based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) adopted for the
  use in home energy management systems (HEMS). The present work describes a smart
  microgrid architecture with a focus on LSTM and GA. The experiments demonstrate
  that the developed algorithms generate a stable pattern of daily power demand. The
  use of the developed algorithms allows automated shifting of power to achieve the
  lowest price without sacrificing their comfort. The main contributions of the present
  work are the inclusion of all parts of the smart microgrid architecture (non-invasive
  load identification, forecasting, optimization, renewable energy sources and storage
  elements) in the research proposing a fully automated control in HEMS rather than
  recommendation based only.
