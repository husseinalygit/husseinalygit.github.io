abstract: Diabetes has become a leading cause of death worldwide. Although there is
  no cure for diabetes, blood glucose monitoring combined with appropriate medication
  can enhance treatment efficiency, alleviate the symptoms, as well as diminish the
  complications. For point-of-care purposes, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices
  are considered to be the best candidates for diabetes therapy. This review focuses
  on current growth areas of CGM technologies, specifically focusing on subcutaneous
  implantable electrochemical glucose sensors. The superiority of CGM systems is introduced
  firstly, and then the strategies for fabrication of minimally-invasive and non-invasive
  CGM biosensors are discussed, respectively. Finally, we briefly outline the current
  status and future perspective for CGM systems.
