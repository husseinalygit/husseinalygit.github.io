abstract: The performance of pulse oximeters is highly influenced by motion artifacts
  (MAs) in photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals. In this paper, we propose a simple
  and efficient approach based on adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) adaptive
  filter for reducing MA in corrupted PPG signals. The presented method is an extension
  to our prior work on efficient use of adaptive filters for reduction of MA in PPG
  signals. The novelty of the method lies in the fact that a synthetic noise reference
  signal for an adaptive filtering process, representing MA noise, is generated internally
  from the MA-corrupted PPG signal itself instead of using any additional hardware
  such as accelerometer or source-detector pair for acquiring noise reference signal.
  Thus, the generated noise reference signal is then applied to the AS-LMS adaptive
  filter for artifact removal. While experimental results proved the efficacy of the
  proposed scheme, the merit of the method is clearly demonstrated using convergence
  and correlation analysis, thus making it best suitable for present-day pulse oximeters
  utilizing PPG sensor head with a single pair of source and detector, which does
  not have any extra hardware meant for capturing noise reference signal. In addition
  to arterial oxygen saturation estimation, the artifact reduction method facilitated
  the waveform contour analysis on artifact-reduced PPG, and the conventional parameters
  were evaluated for assessing the arterial stiffness.
