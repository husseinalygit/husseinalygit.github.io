abstract: Electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin
  provides a new route for noninvasive glucose monitoring without painful blood collection.
  However, sweat-based glucose sensing still faces many challenges, such as difficulty
  in sweat collection, activity variation of glucose oxidase due to lactic acid secretion
  and ambient temperature changes, and delamination of the enzyme when exposed to
  mechanical friction and skin deformation. Precise point-of-care therapy in response
  to the measured glucose levels is still very challenging. We present a wearable/disposable
  sweat-based glucose monitoring device integrated with a feedback transdermal drug
  delivery module. Careful multilayer patch design and miniaturization of sensors
  increase the efficiency of the sweat collection and sensing process. Multimodal
  glucose sensing, as well as its real-time correction based on pH, temperature, and
  humidity measurements, maximizes the accuracy of the sensing. The minimal layout
  design of the same sensors also enables a strip-type disposable device. Drugs for
  the feedback transdermal therapy are loaded on two different temperature-responsive
  phase change nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are embedded in hyaluronic acid
  hydrogel microneedles, which are additionally coated with phase change materials.
  This enables multistage, spatially patterned, and precisely controlled drug release
  in response to the patientâ€™s glucose level. The system provides a novel closed-loop
  solution for the noninvasive sweat-based management of diabetes mellitus. A sweat-based
  glucose monitoring device with transdermal drug delivery is developed for noninvasive
  diabetes treatment. A sweat-based glucose monitoring device with transdermal drug
  delivery is developed for noninvasive diabetes treatment.
