 abstract = {Data-sets play a crucial role in advancing the research. However, getting access to real-world data becomes difficult when it comes to critical infrastructures and more so if that data is being acquired for security research. In this work, a comprehensive dataset from a real-world smart electric grid testbed is collected and shared with the research community. A few of the unique features of the dataset and testbed are highlighted. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},
