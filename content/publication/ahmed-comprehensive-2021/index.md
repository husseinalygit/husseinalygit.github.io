abstract: Data-sets play a crucial role in advancing the research. However, getting
  access to real-world data becomes difficult when it comes to critical infrastructures
  and more so if that data is being acquired for security research. In this work,
  a comprehensive dataset from a real-world smart electric grid testbed is collected
  and shared with the research community. A few of the unique features of the dataset
  and testbed are highlighted. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
