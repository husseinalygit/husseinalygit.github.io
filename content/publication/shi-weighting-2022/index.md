abstract: In this paper, we first introduce batch normalization to the edRVFL network.
  This re-normalization method can help the network avoid divergence of the hidden
  features. Then we propose novel variants of Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional
  Link (edRVFL). Weighted edRVFL (WedRVFL) uses weighting methods to give training
  samples different weights in different layers according to how the samples were
  classified confidently in the previous layer thereby increasing the ensemble's diversity
  and accuracy. Furthermore, a pruning-based edRVFL (PedRVFL) has also been proposed.
  We prune some inferior neurons based on their importance for classification before
  generating the next hidden layer. Through this method, we ensure that the randomly
  generated inferior features will not propagate to deeper layers. Subsequently, the
  combination of weighting and pruning, called Weighting and Pruning based Ensemble
  Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network (WPedRVFL), is proposed. We compare their
  performances with other state-of-the-art deep feedforward neural networks (FNNs)
  on 24 tabular UCI classification datasets. The experimental results illustrate the
  superior performance of our proposed methods.
