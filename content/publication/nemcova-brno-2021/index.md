abstract: 'To the best of our knowledge, there is no annotated database of PPG signals
  recorded by smartphone publicly available. This article introduces Brno University
  of Technology Smartphone PPG Database (BUT PPG) which is an original database created
  by the cardiology team at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno University
  of Technology, for the purpose of evaluating photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal
  quality and estimation of heart rate (HR). The data comprises 48 10-second recordings
  of PPGs and associated electrocardiographic (ECG) signals used for determination
  of reference HR. The data were collected from 12 subjects (6 female, 6 male) aged
  between 21 and 61. PPG data were collected by smartphone Xiaomi Mi9 with sampling
  frequency of 30 Hz. Reference ECG signals were recorded using a mobile ECG recorder
  (Bittium Faros 360) with a sampling frequency of 1,000 Hz. Each PPG signal includes
  annotation of quality created manually by biomedical experts and reference HR. PPG
  signal quality is indicated binary: 1 indicates good quality for HR estimation,
  0 indicates signals where HR cannot be detected reliably, and thus, these signals
  are unsuitable for further analysis. As the only available database containing PPG
  signals recorded by smartphone, BUT PPG is a unique tool for the development of
  smart, user-friendly, cheap, on-the-spot, self-home-monitoring of heart rate with
  the potential of widespread using.'
