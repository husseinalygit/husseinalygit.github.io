abstract: Monitoring diabetes saves lives. To this end, we introduce a novel, unobtrusive,
  and readily deployable in-ear device for the continuous and non-invasive measurement
  of blood glucose levels (BGLs). The device is equipped with a low-cost commercially
  available pulse oximeter whose infrared wavelength (880 nm) is used for the acquisition
  of photoplethysmography (PPG). For rigor, we considered a full range of diabetic
  conditions (non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, type I diabetic, and type II diabetic).
  Recordings spanned nine different days, starting in the morning while fasting, up
  to a minimum of a two-hour period after eating a carbohydrate-rich breakfast. The
  BGLs from PPG were estimated using a suite of regression-based machine learning
  models, which were trained on characteristic features of PPG cycles pertaining to
  high and low BGLs. The analysis shows that, as desired, an average of 82% of the
  BGLs estimated from PPG lie in region A of the Clarke error grid (CEG) plot, with
  100% of the estimated BGLs in the clinically acceptable CEG regions A and B. These
  results demonstrate the potential of the ear canal as a site for non-invasive blood
  glucose monitoring.
