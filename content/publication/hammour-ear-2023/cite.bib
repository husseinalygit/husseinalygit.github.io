 abstract = {Monitoring diabetes saves lives. To this end, we introduce a novel, unobtrusive, and readily deployable in-ear device for the continuous and non-invasive measurement of blood glucose levels (BGLs). The device is equipped with a low-cost commercially available pulse oximeter whose infrared wavelength (880 nm) is used for the acquisition of photoplethysmography (PPG). For rigor, we considered a full range of diabetic conditions (non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, type I diabetic, and type II diabetic). Recordings spanned nine different days, starting in the morning while fasting, up to a minimum of a two-hour period after eating a carbohydrate-rich breakfast. The BGLs from PPG were estimated using a suite of regression-based machine learning models, which were trained on characteristic features of PPG cycles pertaining to high and low BGLs. The analysis shows that, as desired, an average of 82% of the BGLs estimated from PPG lie in region A of the Clarke error grid (CEG) plot, with 100% of the estimated BGLs in the clinically acceptable CEG regions A and B. These results demonstrate the potential of the ear canal as a site for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring.},
