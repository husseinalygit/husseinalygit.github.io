abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming the mainstream transport means in the
  near future and will play an important role in smart grids with the benefit of energy
  storage and power factor improvement. Identifying the EV models connected to the
  power grid for accurate balance in Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-for-Grid operations
  is crucial. This paper proposes a novel non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) method
  based on Weighted Power Recurrence Graphs (WPRG) at a 16.5Â kHz sampling rate to
  accomplish EV model identification irrespective of brand and state of charge (SOC).
  WPRG can consider the relationship between voltages and currents and thus increase
  the variance of original electrical current values by using the extracted current
  and voltage waveforms. The proposed method is tested in a synthetic dataset composed
  of simulated EV charging loads combined with SOC information and a real-world household
  appliance dataset. The proposed WPRG method is compared with two weighted-based
  methods in the NILM background. The proposed WPRG method shows superior performance
  in identifying EV models and other household appliances than the other two weighted-based
  methods, with an overall macro F1-score of 94.3% in identifying the whole charging
  loads in households.
