abstract: The edge of the smart grid has a massive number of power and resource-constrained
  interconnected devices. Mainly, smart meters report power consumption data from
  consumer homes, industrial buildings, and other connected infrastructures. Multiple
  approaches were proposed in the literature to preserve the privacy of consumers
  by altering the data via additive noise, masking, or other data obfuscation techniques.
  A significant body of work in the literature employs differential privacy methods
  with constraining predefined parameters to achieve the optimal trade-off between
  privacy and utility of the data. However, billing accuracy can be degraded by using
  such additive noise techniques. We propose a differentially-private model that perturbs
  data by adding noise obtained from a virtual chargeable battery, while maintaining
  billing accuracy. Our model utilizes fog-computing data aggregation with lightweight
  cryptographic primitives to ensure the authenticity and confidentiality of data
  generated by low-end devices. We describe our differentially-private model with
  flexible constraints and a dynamic window algorithm to maintain the privacy-budget
  loss in infinitely generated time-series data. Our experimental results show a possible
  decrease in data perturbation error by 51.7% and 61.2% for smart meters and fog-computing
  data aggregators perturbed data, respectively, compared to the commonly used Gaussian
  mechanism.
