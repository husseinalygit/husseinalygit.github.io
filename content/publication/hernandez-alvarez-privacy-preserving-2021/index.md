abstract: Ensuring the confidentiality of private data stored in our technological
  devices is a fundamental aspect for protecting our personal and professional information.
  Authentication procedures are among the main methods used to achieve this protection
  and, typically, are implemented only when accessing the device. Nevertheless, in
  many occasions it is necessary to carry out user authentication in a continuous
  manner to guarantee an allowed use of the device while protecting authentication
  data. In this work, we first review the state of the art of Continuous Authentication
  (CA), User Profiling (UP), and related biometric databases. Secondly, we summarize
  the privacy-preserving methods employed to protect the security of sensor-based
  data used to conduct user authentication, and some practical examples of their utilization.
  The analysis of the literature of these topics reveals the importance of sensor-based
  data to protect personal and professional information, as well as the need for exploring
  a combination of more biometric features with privacy-preserving approaches.
