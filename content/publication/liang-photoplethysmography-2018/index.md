abstract: 'Blood pressure is a basic physiological parameter in the cardiovascular
  circulatory system. Long-term abnormal blood pressure will lead to various cardiovascular
  diseases, making the early detection and assessment of hypertension profoundly significant
  for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we investigate
  whether or not deep learning can provide better results for hypertension risk stratification
  when compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction methods.
  We tested a deep learning method for the classification and evaluation of hypertension
  using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals based on the continuous wavelet transform
  (using Morse) and pretrained convolutional neural network (using GoogLeNet). We
  collected 121 data recordings from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in
  Intensive Care (MIMIC) Database, each containing arterial blood pressure (ABP) and
  photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The ABP signals were utilized to extract blood
  pressure category labels, and the PPG signals were used to train and test the model.
  According to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee, blood pressure
  levels are categorized as normotension (NT), prehypertension (PHT), and hypertension
  (HT). For the early diagnosis and assessment of HT, the timely detection of PHT
  and the accurate diagnosis of HT are significant. Therefore, three HT classification
  trials were set: NT vs. PHT, NT vs. HT, and (NT + PHT) vs. HT. The F-scores of these
  three classification trials were 80.52%, 92.55%, and 82.95%, respectively. The tested
  deep method achieved higher accuracy for hypertension risk stratification when compared
  to the classical signal processing and feature extraction method. Additionally,
  the method achieved comparable results to another approach that requires electrocardiogram
  and PPG signals.'
