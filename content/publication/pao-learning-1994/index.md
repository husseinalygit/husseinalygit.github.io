abstract: In this paper we explore and discuss the learning and generalization characteristics
  of the random vector version of the Functional-link net and compare these with those
  attainable with the GDR algorithm. This is done for a well-behaved deterministic
  function and for real-world data. It seems that ‘overtraining’ occurs for stochastic
  mappings. Otherwise there is saturation of training.
