 abstract = {In this paper we explore and discuss the learning and generalization characteristics of the random vector version of the Functional-link net and compare these with those attainable with the GDR algorithm. This is done for a well-behaved deterministic function and for real-world data. It seems that ‘overtraining’ occurs for stochastic mappings. Otherwise there is saturation of training.},
