abstract: In search of the silver bullet to solve the password problem, the field
  of knowledge-based authentication has become bloated with novel proposals aiming
  to replace textual passwords. The emphasis on the quantity of studies as opposed
  to the quality of evaluation has made it difficult to compare the methods, as well
  as to validate and generalize the results. To improve the quality of security and
  usability evaluations, experimental design decisions should be reviewed and standardized.
  In this systematic review, we focus on the evaluation of the shoulder surfing attack
  (SSA) vulnerability. We formulate two research questions to help us determine how
  the design of the method should affect the SSA experimental design process, and
  how different design decisions affect the validity and interpretability of the results
  under various assumptions and threat models. To provide the researchers with comprehensive
  literature on SSA evaluation, we identify empirical shoulder surfing studies conforming
  to a predefined set of quality criteria. Based on the design features extracted
  from the experiments, we develop an evaluation framework for the assessment of the
  shoulder surfing experimental setup. In the follow-up analysis, we assess the proposed
  methods’ design features, and the quality of their SSA experiments, using Schaub
  et al.’s design aspect and our SSA evaluation frameworks, respectively. Through
  exhaustive analysis, we strive to streamline and standardize experimental decisions
  by showcasing their impact on the outcome of the study, and generate guidelines
  for a more objective design of shoulder surfing experiments.
