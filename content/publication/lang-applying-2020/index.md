abstract: Lang, ChristianSteinborn, FlorianSteffens, OliverLang, Elmar W.This paper
  presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) which can be used for forecasting
  electricity load profiles 36 hours into the future. In contrast to well established
  CNN architectures, the input data is one-dimensional. A parameter scanning of network
  parameters is conducted in order to gain information about the influence of the
  kernel size, number of filters and number of nodes. Furthermore, different dropout
  methods are applied to the CNN and are evaluated. The results show that a good forecast
  quality can already be achieved with basic CNN architectures, the dropout improves
  the forecast. The method works not only for smooth sum loads of many hundred consumers,
  but also for the load of single apartment buildings.
