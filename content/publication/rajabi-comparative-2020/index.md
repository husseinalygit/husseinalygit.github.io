abstract: Smart meters have been widely deployed in power networks since the last
  decade. This trend has resulted in an enormous volume of data being collected from
  the electricity customers. To gain benefits for various stakeholders in power systems,
  proper data mining techniques, such as clustering, need to be employed to extract
  the underlying patterns from energy consumptions. In this paper, a comparative study
  of different techniques for load pattern clustering is carried out. Different parameters
  of the methods that affect the clustering results are evaluated and the clustering
  algorithms are compared for two data sets. In addition, the two suitable and commonly
  used data size reduction techniques and feature definition/extraction methods for
  load pattern clustering are analysed. Furthermore, the existing studies on clustering
  of electricity customers are reviewed and the main results are highlighted. Finally,
  the future trends and major applications of clustering consumption patterns are
  outlined to inform industry practitioners and academic researchers to optimize smart
  meter operational use and effectiveness.
