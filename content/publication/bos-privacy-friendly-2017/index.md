abstract: While the smart grid has the potential to have a positive impact on the
  sustainability and efficiency of the electricity market, it also poses some serious
  challenges with respect to the privacy of the consumer. One of the traditional use-cases
  of this privacy sensitive data is the usage for forecast prediction. In this paper
  we show how to compute the forecast prediction such that the supplier does not learn
  any individual consumer usage information. This is achieved by using the Fan-Vercauteren
  somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme. Typical prediction algorithms are based
  on artificial neural networks that require the computation of an activation function
  which is complicated to compute homomorphically. We investigate a different approach
  and show that Ivakhnenkoâ€™s group method of data handling is suitable for homomorphic
  computation.
