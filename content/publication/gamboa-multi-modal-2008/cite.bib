 abstract = {Human behavior gained much attention as a means of identifying a subject from the dynamics of some of its signals. This produced challenging questions, opening a broad area of signals to explore and new methodologies to propose in answering a difficult problem: How to extract, combine and classify characteristics from dynamic sources to distinguish a large number of classes. This thesis addresses this broad issue of behavioral biometrics, introducing new signal sources, novel signal models and advanced classification strategies in a multidisciplinary approach.
Signals of Human-Computer Interaction from the mouse movement were collected using a new remote interaction acquisition system developed in the context of the present thesis. The Electrocardiography and Electrodermal Activity signals were also collected and their relation to the subject identity has been studied. Original contributions, in terms of novel signals and processing models, form the basis of the processing and feature extraction tools. The data modeling and classification of these signals is a hard task that arises from the difficulty in data separation. Original theoretical and algorithmic contributions addressing this issue are proposed in the thesis, namely usertuned feature selection, sequential classification, and fusion under uncertainty. These approaches, with a set of computational improvements, show the potential of these new behavioral biometrics traits, both in single and multimodal biometrics scenarios.},
