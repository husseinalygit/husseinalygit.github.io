abstract: Biometric verification has been included in remote user authentication schemes
  recently. In this paper, we have proposed the use of heartbeat biometrics for its
  liveness property as a possible defense against spoof attacks in remote authentication.
  Sensor embedded mobile computing devices such as smart phones could be used to capture
  biometric signals and to replace the use of traditional smart cards. For the remote
  authentication, we have adopted the state-of-the-art scheme. We have described the
  biometric verification method instead of using cryptographic hash function for feature
  matching. We have used the piecewise aligned morphology (PAM) of heartbeat signal
  as a biometric feature. The biometric verification method was tested with ECG records
  of 100 individuals and 1.34% of equal error rate (EER) was obtained. This feature
  could be computed and transmitted efficiently using mobile computing devices. The
  proposed scheme offers more security and convenience to users. Additionally, it
  becomes robust against noisy biometric input. The proposed scheme should be feasible
  for remote authentication using sensor embedded computing devices in many practical
  applications such as remote healthcare.
