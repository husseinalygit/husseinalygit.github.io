abstract: Recently, wrist-worn smart devices such as smart-watches are becoming popular,
  and there is a growing need for authentication systems on such devices. Many wrist-worn
  devices contain a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor with a purpose of measuring
  the user's heart rate. In this paper, in addition to using the PPG sensor to measure
  the heart rate, we use it to detect the user's hand movement. In our proposed method,
  we use not only the information of the hand movement, but also that of the stationary
  state to improve the robustness of authentication. We obtained the PPG signals from
  15 subjects, whom in the experiment were asked to bend their wrist and put it back
  for several times, continuously. The results of the experiments revealed that a
  continuous wrist movement of three times achieved an equal error rate of 11.6 %,
  and a movement of nine times achieved an equal error rate of 8.8 %.
