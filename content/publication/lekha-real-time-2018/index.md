abstract: Non-invasive diabetes prediction has been gaining prominence over the last
  decade. Among many human serums evaluated, human breath emerges as a promising option
  with acetone levels in breath exhibiting a good correlation to blood glucose levels.
  Such correlation establishes acetone as an acceptable biomarker for diabetes. The
  most common data analysis strategies to analyze the biomarkers in breath for disease
  detection use feature extraction and classification algorithms. However, snags such
  as computational cost and lack of optimal feature selection on application to real-time
  signals reduce the efficiency of such analysis. This paper explores the use of a
  one-dimensional (1-D) modified convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm that combines
  feature extraction and classification techniques. The approach proposed in this
  paper is found to significantly reduce the limitations associated with using these
  techniques individually and thereby improving the classifier's performance further.
  This paper proposes to apply a modified 1-D CNN on real-time breath signals obtained
  from an array of gas sensors. The experimentation and the performance of the system
  is carried out and evaluated.
