abstract: Recent years have seen the rapid development of technologies in Smart Grids
  (SGs) to enhance electricity networks with digital and data communication technologies.
  SGs can proactively detect, react, and respond to dynamic changes in the network.
  SGs can also enhance the efficiency and reliability of electricity supplies and
  promote the integration of renewable energy sources. Smart Meters (SMs) are often
  seen as the first step to a successful implementation of SGs. While SMs enable Utility
  Providers and consumers to obtain near real-time information of energy consumption,
  they can also be exploited to infer sensitive consumer data. Therefore, privacy
  preservation in SMs is paramount in ensuring the widespread and successful deployment
  of SGs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art
  SM privacy-preserving techniques published in the literature over the past decade.
  We categorize these techniques based on the attack types and their objectives. We
  aim to offer a unique perspective in this survey article through the lens of privacy
  preservation, cross-cutting the wide range of techniques presented in the literature.
  We conclude by identifying the challenges and highlighting key future research directions
  in the field.
