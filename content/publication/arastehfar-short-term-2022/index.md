abstract: The abundance of energy consumption data collected by smart meters has inspired
  researchers to employ deep neural networks to solve the existing problems in the
  power industry, such as Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF). Most studies addressing
  the STLF problem, focus on historical load data and to achieve higher performance,
  they supplement costly accessible environmental and calendar variables with data.
  This approach ignores the existing spatial information among the consumers which
  subsequently might lead into the emergence of similar consumption patterns. In this
  paper, we present a Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, a novel neural
  architecture, for STLF problem that combines Graph Convolutional Networks and Long
  Short-Term Memory networks to simultaneously extract spatial and temporal information
  from users with similar consumption patterns. Our model captures spatial information
  from users without prior knowledge of their geographic location and does not rely
  on additional environmental variables. We compared our model to traditional baseline
  models for STLF using two real-world electricity consumption datasets. The empirical
  results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction compared with the baseline
  models, exhibiting a 9.5% and an 8% improvement in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage
  Error, in the Customer Behavior Trials and Low Carbon London datasets, respectively.
