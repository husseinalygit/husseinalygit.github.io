abstract: This letter discusses non-iterative learning methods with closed-form solution
  such as the kernel ridge regression and randomization based single hidden layer
  feedforward neural networks like random vector functional link (RVFL). Similarities
  and differences between these methods are also discussed. Irrelevance of kernel-trick
  for randomized neural networks is explained. The need for dual formulation or constrained
  optimization formulation for kernel methods and RVFL is distinguished. Finally,
  the articles in this special issue focusing on non-iterative learning methods with
  closed-form solution are summarized. A common conclusion in these articles is that
  the RVFL developed in the early 1990s outperforms the extreme learning machines
  (ELM). This conclusion is consistent with the earlier findings [1], [2], [3] that
  the direct links enhance the performance of the RVFL.
