abstract: Face and fingerprint are, currently, the most thoroughly explored biometric
  traits, promising reliable recognition in diverse applications. Commercial products
  using these traits for biometric identification or authentication are increasingly
  widespread, from smartphones to border control. However, increasingly smart techniques
  to counterfeit such traits raise the need for traits that are less vulnerable to
  stealthy trait measurement or spoofing attacks. This has sparked interest on the
  electrocardiogram (ECG), most commonly associated with medical diagnosis, whose
  hidden nature and inherent liveness information make it highly resistant to attacks.
  In the last years, the topic of ECG-based biometrics has quickly evolved toward
  the commercial applications, mainly by addressing the reduced acceptability and
  comfort by proposing new off-the-person, wearable, and seamless acquisition settings.
  Furthermore, researchers have recently started to address the issues of spoofing
  prevention and data security in ECG biometrics, as well as the potential of deep
  learning methodologies to enhance the recognition accuracy and robustness. In this
  paper, we conduct a deep review and discussion of 93 state-of-the-art publications
  on their proposed methods, signal datasets, and publicly available ECG collections.
  The extracted knowledge is used to present the fundamentals and the evolution of
  ECG biometrics, describe the current state of the art, and draw conclusions on prior
  art approaches and current challenges. With this paper, we aim to delve into the
  current opportunities as well as inspire and guide future research in ECG biometrics.
