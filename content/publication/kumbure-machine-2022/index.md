abstract: 'In this literature review, we investigate machine learning techniques that
  are applied for stock market prediction. A focus area in this literature review
  is the stock markets investigated in the literature as well as the types of variables
  used as input in the machine learning techniques used for predicting these markets.
  We examined 138 journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. The main contributions
  of this review are: (1) an extensive examination of the data, in particular, the
  markets and stock indices covered in the predictions, as well as the 2173 unique
  variables used for stock market predictions, including technical indicators, macro-economic
  variables, and fundamental indicators, and (2) an in-depth review of the machine
  learning techniques and their variants deployed for the predictions. In addition,
  we provide a bibliometric analysis of these journal articles, highlighting the most
  influential works and articles.'
