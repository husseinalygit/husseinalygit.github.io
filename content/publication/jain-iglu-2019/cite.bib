 abstract = {In the case of diabetes, fingertip pricking for blood sample is inconvenient for glucose measurement. Invasive approaches like laboratory tests and one touch glucometers enhance the risk of blood related infections. To mitigate this important issue, this article introduces a novel Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) enabled edge-device for precise, noninvasive blood glucose measurement. The device called "Intelligent Glucose Meter" (i.e., iGLU) is based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and a machine learning model of high accuracy. iGLU has been validated in a hospital and blood glucose values are stored in an IoMT platform for remote monitoring by endocrinologists.},
