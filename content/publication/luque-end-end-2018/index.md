abstract: 'Whilst research efforts have traditionally focused on Electrocardiographic
  (ECG) signals and handcrafted features as potential biometric traits, few works
  have explored systems based on the raw pho-toplethysmogram (PPG) signal. This work
  proposes an end-to-end architecture to offer biometric authentication using PPG
  biosensors through Convolutional Networks. We provide an evaluation of the performance
  of our approach in two different databases: Troika and PulseID, the latter a publicly
  available database specifically collected by the authors for such a purpose. Our
  verification approach through convolutional network based models and using raw PPG
  signals appears to be viable in current monitoring procedures within e-health and
  fitness environments showing a remarkable potential as a biometry. The approach
  tested on a verification fashion, on trials lasting one second, achieved an AUC
  of 78.2% and 83.2%, averaged among target subjects, on PulseID and Troika datasets
  respectively. Our experimental results on previous small datasets support the usefulness
  of PPG extracted biomarkers as viable traits for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics.
  Furthermore, the approach results in a low input throughput and complexity that
  allows for a continuous authentication in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, the
  reported experiments also suggest that further research is necessary to account
  for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects.'
