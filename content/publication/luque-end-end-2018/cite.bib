 abstract = {Whilst research efforts have traditionally focused on Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals and handcrafted features as potential biometric traits, few works have explored systems based on the raw pho-toplethysmogram (PPG) signal. This work proposes an end-to-end architecture to offer biometric authentication using PPG biosensors through Convolutional Networks. We provide an evaluation of the performance of our approach in two different databases: Troika and PulseID, the latter a publicly available database specifically collected by the authors for such a purpose. Our verification approach through convolutional network based models and using raw PPG signals appears to be viable in current monitoring procedures within e-health and fitness environments showing a remarkable potential as a biometry. The approach tested on a verification fashion, on trials lasting one second, achieved an AUC of 78.2% and 83.2%, averaged among target subjects, on PulseID and Troika datasets respectively. Our experimental results on previous small datasets support the usefulness of PPG extracted biomarkers as viable traits for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics. Furthermore, the approach results in a low input throughput and complexity that allows for a continuous authentication in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, the reported experiments also suggest that further research is necessary to account for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects.},
