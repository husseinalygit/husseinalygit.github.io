abstract: Biometric systems suffer from a fundamental vulnerability to presentation
  attacks which impairs their security and robustness. To overcome this issue, liveness
  detection methods have been introduced to ensure that input data is originating
  from a live human being, and it is not forged from old or artificial data. In case
  of fingerprint and face image-two of the most widely used traits in biometric systems-liveness
  detection methods attempts to detect fake input data such as gummy finger or finger
  image in the former, and printed face image or masks in the latter. A new trend
  in liveness detection methods is moving toward using bio-electrical signals such
  as Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electroencephalography (EEG). These signals are
  believed to have an intrinsic liveness property due to the point that they can only
  be obtained when a live human subject is present. However this is not a realistic
  assumption, since in recent works these signals have been artificially crafted,
  and gotten accepted by biometric systems. Therefore, similar to other traits, liveness
  detection methods for bio-electrical signals need to be developed, and, furthermore
  new approaches to liveness detection should be studied. In this paper, we discuss
  liveness detection challenges, and trade-offs with respect to factors such as usability,
  cost, and performance, and necessary requirements for an evaluation criteria is
  specified. Finally, the current state of art in liveness detection methods are comprehensively
  evaluated using the developed criteria.
