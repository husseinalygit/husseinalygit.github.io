abstract: Auscultation of respiratory sounds is the primary tool for screening and
  diagnosing lung diseases. Automated analysis, coupled with digital stethoscopes,
  can play a crucial role in enabling tele-screening of fatal lung diseases. Deep
  neural networks (DNNs) have shown a lot of promise for such problems, and are an
  obvious choice. However, DNNs are extremely data hungry, and the largest respiratory
  dataset ICBHI has only 6898 breathing cycles, which is still small for training
  a satisfactory DNN model. In this work, RespireNet, we propose a simple CNN-based
  model, along with a suite of novel techniques---device specific fine-tuning, concatenation-based
  augmentation, blank region clipping, and smart padding---enabling us to efficiently
  use the small-sized dataset. We perform extensive evaluation on the ICBHI dataset,
  and improve upon the state-of-the-art results for 4-class classification by 2.2%
