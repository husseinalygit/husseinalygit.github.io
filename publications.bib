	abstract = {Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram ({ECG})-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw {ECG} signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the {ECG} signal (e.g., T-wave, {ST}-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming system using short excerpts of {ECG} signal.},

	abstract = {Objective
This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level ({BGL}) and the systolic ({SBP}) and diastolic ({DBP}) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph ({PPG}) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects.
Methodology
The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the {PPG} waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the {SBP}, {DBP} and {BGL} values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the {PPG} waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels.
Results
As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were {RSBP}2=0.91, {RDBP}2=0.89, and {RBGL}2=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7\% of points in zone A, 10.3\% in zone B, and 1.9\% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society.
Conclusion
An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9\% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.},

Recently there has been an increasing interest in using these devices to improve the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The quality of data acquired through wearable sensors is generally lower than what medical-grade devices provide, and existing datasets have mainly been acquired in highly controlled clinical conditions. In the context of the D1NAMO project — aiming to detect glycemic events through non-invasive {ECG} pattern analysis — we elaborated a dataset that can be used to help developing health-care systems based on wearable devices in non-clinical conditions. This paper describes this dataset, which was acquired on 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the Zephyr {BioHarness} 3 wearable device. The dataset consists of {ECG}, breathing, and accelerometer signals, as well as glucose measurements and annotated food pictures.

	abstract = {Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ({DM}1) patients are used to checking their blood glucose levels several times per day through finger sticks and, by subjectively handling this information, to try to predict their future glycaemia in order to choose a proper strategy to keep their glucose levels under control, in terms of insulin dosages and other factors. However, recent Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring ({CGM}) so that, with the proper Machine Learning ({ML}) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an ‘on-the-fly’ approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, {CGM} study has been carried out with 25 {DM}1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error ({RMSE}) of 11.65 mg/{dL} in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an {RMSE} of 19.90 mg/{dL}. Thus, this paper concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices.},

	abstract = {Background: The Control to Range Study was a multinational artificial pancreas study designed to assess the time spent in the hypo- and hyperglycemic ranges in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes while under closed-loop control. The controller attempted to keep the glucose ranges between 70 and 180 mg/{dL}. A set of prespecified metrics was used to measure safety.Research Design and Methods: We studied 53 individuals for approximately 22 h each during clinical research center admissions. Plasma glucose level was measured every 15–30 min ({YSI} clinical laboratory analyzer instrument [{YSI}, Inc., Yellow Springs, {OH}]). During the admission, subjects received three mixed meals (1 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight; 100 g maximum) with meal announcement and automated insulin dosing by the controller.Results: For adults, the mean of subjects' mean glucose levels was 159 mg/{dL}, and mean percentage of values 71–180 mg/{dL} was 66\% overall (59\% daytime and 82\% overnight). For adolescents, the mean of subjects' mean glucose levels was 166 mg/{dL}, and mean percentage of values in range was 62\% overall (53\% daytime and 82\% overnight). Whereas prespecified criteria for safety were satisfied by both groups, they were met at the individual level in adults only for combined daytime/nighttime and for isolated nighttime. Two adults and six adolescents failed to meet the daytime criterion, largely because of postmeal hyperglycemia, and another adolescent failed to meet the nighttime criterion.Conclusions: The control-to-range system performed as expected: faring better overnight than during the day and performing with variability between patients even after individualization based on patients' prior settings. The system had difficulty preventing postmeal excursions above target range.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: To evaluate physicians' adjustments of insulin pump settings based on continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}) for patients with type 1 diabetes and to compare these to automated insulin dose adjustments.
{METHODS}: A total of 26 physicians from 16 centres in Europe, Israel and South America participated in the study. All were asked to adjust insulin dosing based on insulin pump, {CGM} and glucometer downloads of 15 patients (mean age 16.2 ± 4.3 years, six female, mean glycated haemoglobin 8.3 ± 0.9\% [66.8 ± 7.3 mmol/mol]) gathered over a 3-week period. Recommendations were compared for the relative changes in the basal, carbohydrate to insulin ratio ({CR}) and correction factor ({CF}) plans among physicians and among centres and also between the physicians and an automated algorithm, the Advisor Pro ({DreaMed} Diabetes Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel). Study endpoints were the percentage of comparison points for which there was full agreement on the trend of insulin dose adjustments (same trend), partial agreement (increase/decrease vs no change) and full disagreement (opposite trend).
{RESULTS}: The percentages for full agreement between physicians on the trend of insulin adjustments of the basal, {CR} and {CF} plans were 41 ± 9\%, 45 ± 11\% and 45.5 ± 13\%, and for complete disagreement they were 12 ± 7\%, 9.5 ± 7\% and 10 ± 8\%, respectively. Significantly similar results were found between the physicians and the automated algorithm. The algorithm magnitude of insulin dose change was at least equal to or less than that proposed by the physicians.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Physicians provide different insulin dose recommendations based on the same datasets. The automated advice of the Advisor Pro did not differ significantly from the advice given by the physicians in the direction or magnitude of the insulin dosing.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system which estimates blood glucose level ({BGL}) by non-invasive method using Photoplethysmography ({PPG}). Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the {PPG} signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a {PPG} signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of {BGL} values. A {PPG} data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. {BGL} value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and {BGL} value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of {BGL} value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R2 = 0.81. Further, {BGL} estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for {BGL} estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6\% in class A and 17.4\% in class B. 1\% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique ({SPA}) the distribution of data samples are 83\% in class A and 17\% in class B. The proposed features in {SPA} have shown significant improvement in R2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. {SPA} technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer.},

	abstract = {As wearable technologies are being increasingly used for clinical research and healthcare, it is critical to understand their accuracy and determine how measurement errors may affect research conclusions and impact healthcare decision-making. Accuracy of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography ({PPG}), an optical method for measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in {PPG} stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts, and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and {PPG} data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during activity was, on average, 30\% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions using these devices.},

	abstract = {Keeping track of blood glucose levels non-invasively is now possible due to diverse breakthroughs in wearable sensors technology coupled with advanced biomedical signal processing. However, each user might have different requirements and priorities when it comes to selecting a self-monitoring solution. After extensive research and careful selection, we have presented a comprehensive survey on noninvasive/pain-free blood glucose monitoring methods from the recent five years (2012-2016). Several techniques, from bioinformatics, computer science, chemical engineering, microwave technology, etc., are discussed in order to cover a wide variety of solutions available for different scales and preferences. We categorize the noninvasive techniques into nonsample- and sample-based techniques, which we further grouped into optical, nonoptical, intermittent, and continuous. The devices manufactured or being manufactured for noninvasive monitoring are also compared in this paper. These techniques are then analyzed based on certain constraints, which include time efficiency, comfort, cost, portability, power consumption, etc., a user might experience. Recalibration, time, and power efficiency are the biggest challenges that require further research in order to satisfy a large number of users. In order to solve these challenges, artificial intelligence ({AI}) has been employed by many researchers. {AI}-based estimation and decision models hold the future of noninvasive glucose monitoring in terms of accuracy, cost effectiveness, portability, efficiency, etc. The significance of this paper is twofold: first, to bridge the gap between {IT} and medical field; and second, to bridge the gap between end users and the solutions (hardware and software).},

Continuous monitoring systems allow subjects to prepare the diabetes management strategy and prevent the long-term complications diseases. Until now, most studies utilize various biofluids such as sweat, tears and saliva that have serious unresolved setback such as expensive material, sensor stability, sensor calibration and long-settling time. Therefore, we developed a novel {BG} sensor which is cost efficient and highly wearable with a small data acquisition time window that allow a non-invasive, long-term continuous blood glucose monitoring ({CGM}) system. The novel biosensor exploits a unique information of the pulsatile to continuous components of the arterial blood volume pulsation during the change of blood glucose ({BG}) concentration at the wrist tissue. The reflected optical signal was measured in the combine visible-near infrared (Vis-{NIR}) spectroscopy. An in-vivo experiment which enclosed 12 volunteers in a two-hour modified carbohydrate-rich meals reached the average correlation coefficient (Rp) between the estimated and reference {BG} concentration of 0.86, with the standard prediction error ({SPE}) of 6.16 mg/dl. Moreover, the full-day experiment was also conducted to test the reliability of the proposed sensor. Results showed that the created model in the previous day, may estimate a full-day {BG} concentration which was done in next day with an adequate performance.},

This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of a machine-learning-based prediction model to anticipate {NH} in T1D patients on {MDI}. (2) Methods: ten T1D adults were studied during 12 weeks. Information regarding T1D management, continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}), and from a physical activity tracker were obtained under free-living conditions at home. Supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied to the data, and prediction models were created to forecast the occurrence of {NH}. Individualized prediction models were generated using multilayer perceptron ({MLP}) and a support vector machine ({SVM}). (3) Results: population outcomes indicated that more than 70\% of the {NH} may be avoided with the proposed methodology. The predictions performed by the {SVM} achieved the best population outcomes, with a sensitivity and specificity of 78.75\% and 82.15\%, respectively.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the progressive failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in type-2 diabetes remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic βV59M mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in {NADH} and {ATP} are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. {INS}-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and {ATP} synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of β-cells in diabetes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from T cell-mediated β cell destruction in the pancreas of genetically susceptible individuals. Extensive familial and population genetic studies uncovered the strong linkage and association between \textit{{HLA}} gene variants and T1D. Non-\textit{{HLA}} genes have also been associated with T1D, such as \textit{{INS}}, \textit{{CTLA}4}, and \textit{{PTPN}22}. T1D is considered as one of the most heritable common diseases. However, evidence that monozygotic twins have incomplete concordance of disease susceptibility provides convincing proof that environmental factors also play important roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. Environmental factors can induce the alterations of gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications refer to the alterations in gene expression without changes of the {DNA} sequence, but instead occur as a result of {DNA} methylation, histone modifications, and {miRNA} regulation. Aberrant epigenetic modifications will cause the dysregulation of gene expression, thus leading to a variety of human diseases. There are significant differences in {DNA} methylation, histone modifications, and {miRNA} profiling found in T1D patients compared with healthy individuals. Epigenetic modifications contribute to the pathogenesis of T1D mainly by regulating the expression of susceptible genes in T1D. These susceptible genes are involved in antigen presentation (such as \textit{{HLA}}), immune tolerance (such as \textit{{FOXP}3} and \textit{{CTLA}4}), autoreactive T cell response (such as \textit{{GAD}65}), and β cell functions (such as \textit{{INS}}). A better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms for regulating susceptible genes of T1D will help identify candidates that target epigenetic pathways to control and/or prevent T1D. Knowledge of epigenetic changes in T1D also provides us with potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognostication, personalized treatment, and prevention of the disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The use of near infra red ({NIR}) photoacoustic spectroscopy ({PAS}) for continuous non-invasive glucose measurement is outlined in the paper. A photoacoustic ({PA}) measurement apparatus was constructed and {PA} measurements were made on glucose solutions at multiple {NIR} excitation wavelengths. A variety of time and frequency domain features, including amplitude and area based features, were extracted from the {PA} measurements. These features were observed to be proportional to the glucose concentration of the sample. {PA} measurements from samples of whole blood at different glucose concentrations showed similar results. Subsequently, in vivo {PA} measurements made on a cohort of 30 volunteers were calibrated using a quadratic fit, and the results were compared to reference glucose concentrations made using a regular blood glucose meter. A comparison of 196 measurement pairs of predicted and reference glucose concentrations using a Clarke Error Grid gave a point distribution of 87.24\% and 12.76\% over zones A and B of the grid, with no measurement pairs falling in unacceptable zones C-E of the error grid. The predicted measurements had a mean absolute difference ({MAD}) of 12.57 ± 13.90 mg/dl and a mean absolute relative difference ({MARD}) of 9.61\% ± 10.55\%. This is an improvement over previous results obtained using {PAS} and other non-invasive techniques, validating the potential of {PAS} for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring.},

	abstract = {Diabetes impacts the quality of life of millions of people around the globe. However, diabetes diagnosis is still an arduous process, given that this disease develops and gets treated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors ({WMSs}) and machine learning points to a potential way forward to address this challenge. {WMSs} enable a continuous, yet user-transparent, mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals. However, disease diagnosis based on {WMS} data and its effective deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature extraction and vast computation cost. To address these problems, we propose a framework called {DiabDeep} that combines efficient neural networks (called {DiabNNs}) with off-the-shelf {WMSs} for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. {DiabDeep} bypasses the feature extraction stage and acts directly on {WMS} data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device, e.g., a smartphone, to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals. On the resource-rich server, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the resource-scarce edge device, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to substantially cut down on computation and storage costs while incurring only a minor accuracy loss. At the core of our system lies a grow-and-prune training flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning algorithms to enable {DiabNNs} to learn both weights and connections, while improving accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {DiabDeep} through a detailed analysis of data collected from 52 participants. For server (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3\% (95.3\%) accuracy in classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7\% (94.6\%) accuracy in distinguishing among type-1 diabetic, type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals. Against conventional baselines, such as support vector machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear ridge classifiers, {DiabNNs} achieve higher accuracy, while reducing the model size (floating-point operations) by up to 
\$454.5 {\textbackslash}times (8.9{\textbackslash}times)\$
. Therefore, the system can be viewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.},

	abstract = {The automatic analysis of respiratory sounds has been a field of great research interest during the last decades. Automated classification of respiratory sounds has the potential to detect abnormalities in the early stages of a respiratory dysfunction and thus enhance the effectiveness of decision making. However, the existence of a publically available large database, in which new algorithms can be implemented, evaluated, and compared, is still lacking and is vital for further developments in the field. In the context of the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics ({ICBHI}), the first scientific challenge was organized with the main goal of developing algorithms able to characterize respiratory sound recordings derived from clinical and non-clinical environments. The database was created by two research teams in Portugal and in Greece, and it includes 920 recordings acquired from 126 subjects. A total of 6898 respiration cycles were recorded. The cycles were annotated by respiratory experts as including crackles, wheezes, a combination of them, or no adventitious respiratory sounds. The recordings were collected using heterogeneous equipment and their duration ranged from 10 to 90 s. The chest locations from which the recordings were acquired was also provided. Noise levels in some respiration cycles were high, which simulated real life conditions and made the classification process more challenging.},

Crackles automatic detection in a respiratory sound file is challenging, and thus different signal processing methodologies have been proposed. However, limited testing of such methodologies, namely in respiratory sound files collected in clinical settings, has been conducted. This study aimed to develop an algorithm for automatic crackle detection and characterisation and to evaluate its performance and accuracy against a multi-annotator gold standard. The algorithm is based on three main procedures: i) extraction of a window of interest of a potential crackle (based on fractal dimension and box filtering techniques); ii) verification of the validity of the potential crackle considering computerised respiratory sound analysis established criteria; and iii) characterisation and extraction of crackle parameters. Twenty four 10-second files, acquired in clinical settings, were selected from 10 patients with pneumonia and cystic fibrosis. The algorithm performance was assessed by comparing its results with gold standard annotations (obtained by the agreement among three experts). A set of 7 parameters was optimised. High levels of sensitivity ({SE}=89\%), positive predictive value ({PPV}=95\%) and overall performance (F index=92\%) were achieved. This promising result highlights the potential of the algorithm for automatic crackle's detection/characterisation in respiratory sounds acquired in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time ({PTT}). Although it is proven that {PTT} has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from {PTT}, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society ({BHS}) protocol.},

	abstract = {Blood pressure is a basic physiological parameter in the cardiovascular circulatory system. Long-term abnormal blood pressure will lead to various cardiovascular diseases, making the early detection and assessment of hypertension profoundly significant for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we investigate whether or not deep learning can provide better results for hypertension risk stratification when compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction methods. We tested a deep learning method for the classification and evaluation of hypertension using photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signals based on the continuous wavelet transform (using Morse) and pretrained convolutional neural network (using {GoogLeNet}). We collected 121 data recordings from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care ({MIMIC}) Database, each containing arterial blood pressure ({ABP}) and photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signals. The {ABP} signals were utilized to extract blood pressure category labels, and the {PPG} signals were used to train and test the model. According to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee, blood pressure levels are categorized as normotension ({NT}), prehypertension ({PHT}), and hypertension ({HT}). For the early diagnosis and assessment of {HT}, the timely detection of {PHT} and the accurate diagnosis of {HT} are significant. Therefore, three {HT} classification trials were set: {NT} vs. {PHT}, {NT} vs. {HT}, and ({NT} + {PHT}) vs. {HT}. The F-scores of these three classification trials were 80.52\%, 92.55\%, and 82.95\%, respectively. The tested deep method achieved higher accuracy for hypertension risk stratification when compared to the classical signal processing and feature extraction method. Additionally, the method achieved comparable results to another approach that requires electrocardiogram and {PPG} signals.},

The current glucose measurement approaches still rely on invasive techniques which are uncomfortable and raise the risk of infection. To facilitate daily care at home, in this article, we propose an intelligent, noninvasive blood glucose monitoring system which can differentiate a user's blood glucose level into normal, borderline, and warning based on smartphone photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signals. The main implementation processes of the proposed system include 1) a novel algorithm for acquiring {PPG} signals using only smartphone camera videos; 2) a fitting-based sliding window algorithm to remove varying degrees of baseline drifts and segment the signal into single periods; 3) extracting characteristic features from the Gaussian functions by comparing {PPG} signals at different blood glucose levels; 4) categorizing the valid samples into three glucose levels by applying machine learning algorithms. Our proposed system was evaluated on a data set of 80 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can separate valid signals from invalid ones at an accuracy of 97.54\% and the overall accuracy of estimating the blood glucose levels reaches 81.49\%. The proposed system provides a reference for the introduction of noninvasive blood glucose technology into daily or clinical applications. This article also indicates that smartphone-based {PPG} signals have great potential to assess an individual's blood glucose level.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single {WaveNet} can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

	abstract = {Binaural audio provides a listener with 3D sound sensation, allowing a rich perceptual experience of the scene. However, binaural recordings are scarcely available and require nontrivial expertise and equipment to obtain. We propose to convert common monaural audio into binaural audio by leveraging video. The key idea is that visual frames reveal significant spatial cues that, while explicitly lacking in the accompanying single-channel audio, are strongly linked to it. Our multi-modal approach recovers this link from unlabeled video. We devise a deep convolutional neural network that learns to decode the monaural (single-channel) soundtrack into its binaural counterpart by injecting visual information about object and scene configurations. We call the resulting output 2.5D visual sound---the visual stream helps "lift" the flat single channel audio into spatialized sound. In addition to sound generation, we show the self-supervised representation learned by our network benefits audio-visual source separation.

	abstract = {We describe a neural network-based system for text-to-speech ({TTS}) synthesis that is able to generate speech audio in the voice of many different speakers, including those unseen during training. Our system consists of three independently trained components: (1) a speaker encoder network, trained on a speaker verification task using an independent dataset of noisy speech from thousands of speakers without transcripts, to generate a fixed-dimensional embedding vector from seconds of reference speech from a target speaker; (2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network based on Tacotron 2, which generates a mel spectrogram from text, conditioned on the speaker embedding; (3) an auto-regressive {WaveNet}-based vocoder that converts the mel spectrogram into a sequence of time domain waveform samples. We demonstrate that the proposed model is able to transfer the knowledge of speaker variability learned by the discriminatively-trained speaker encoder to the new task, and is able to synthesize natural speech from speakers that were not seen during training. We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance. Finally, we show that randomly sampled speaker embeddings can be used to synthesize speech in the voice of novel speakers dissimilar from those used in training, indicating that the model has learned a high quality speaker representation.},

	abstract = {We present a joint audio-visual model for isolating a single speech signal from a mixture of sounds such as other speakers and background noise. Solving this task using only audio as input is extremely challenging and does not provide an association of the separated speech signals with speakers in the video. In this paper, we present a deep network-based model that incorporates both visual and auditory signals to solve this task. The visual features are used to "focus" the audio on desired speakers in a scene and to improve the speech separation quality. To train our joint audio-visual model, we introduce {AVSpeech}, a new dataset comprised of thousands of hours of video segments from the Web. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to classic speech separation tasks, as well as real-world scenarios involving heated interviews, noisy bars, and screaming children, only requiring the user to specify the face of the person in the video whose speech they want to isolate. Our method shows clear advantage over state-of-the-art audio-only speech separation in cases of mixed speech. In addition, our model, which is speaker-independent (trained once, applicable to any speaker), produces better results than recent audio-visual speech separation methods that are speaker-dependent (require training a separate model for each speaker of interest).},

	abstract = {Continuous cuffless blood pressure ({BP}) monitoring has attracted much interest in finding the ideal treatment of diseases and the prevention of premature death. This paper presents a novel dynamical method, based on pulse transit time ({PTT}) and photoplethysmogram intensity ratio ({PIR}), for the continuous cuffless {BP} estimation. By taking the advantages of both the modeling and the prediction approaches, the proposed framework effectively estimates diastolic {BP} ({DBP}), mean {BP} ({BP}), and systolic {BP} ({SBP}). Adding past states of the cardiopulmonary system as well as present states of the cardiac system to our model caused two main improvements. First, high accuracy of the method in the beat to beat {BP} estimation. Second, notwithstanding noticeable {BP} changes, the performance of the model is preserved over time. The experimental setup includes comparative studies on a large, standard dataset. Moreover, the proposed method outperformed the most recent and cited algorithms with improved accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recently a few methods have been proposed in the literature for non-invasive cuff-less estimation of systolic and diastolic blood pressures. One of the most prominent methods is to use the Pulse Transit Time ({PTT}). Although it is proven that {PTT} has a strong correlation with the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, this relation is highly dependent to each individuals physiological properties. Therefore, it requires per person calibration for accurate and reliable blood pressure estimation from {PTT}, which is a big drawback. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, a novel method is proposed for accurate and reliable estimation of blood pressure that is calibration-free. This goal is accomplished by extraction of several physiological parameters from Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signal as well as utilizing signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method achieves grade B for the estimation of the diastolic blood pressure and grade C for the estimation of the mean arterial pressure under the standard British Hypertension Society ({BHS}) protocol.},

	abstract = {Feed-forward, fully-connected Artificial Neural Networks ({ANNs}) or the so-called Multi-Layer Perceptrons ({MLPs}) are well-known universal approximators. However, their learning performance varies significantly depending on the function or the solution space that they attempt to approximate. This is mainly because of their homogenous configuration based solely on the linear neuron model. Therefore, while they learn very well those problems with a monotonous, relatively simple and linearly separable solution space, they may entirely fail to do so when the solution space is highly nonlinear and complex. Sharing the same linear neuron model with two additional constraints (local connections and weight sharing), this is also true for the conventional Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) and, it is, therefore, not surprising that in many challenging problems only the deep {CNNs} with a massive complexity and depth can achieve the required diversity and the learning performance. In order to address this drawback and also to accomplish a more generalized model over the convolutional neurons, this study proposes a novel network model, called Operational Neural Networks ({ONNs}), which can be heterogeneous and encapsulate neurons with any set of operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training data. Finally, a novel training method is formulated to back-propagate the error through the operational layers of {ONNs}. Experimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of {ONNs} even with few neurons and hidden layers.},

The use of Raman spectroscopy, with its molecular specificity, has been investigated in this regard over the past decade. Previous studies reported on glucose sensing based on indirect evidence such as statistical correlation to the reference glucose concentration. However, these claims fail to demonstrate glucose Raman peaks, which has raised questions regarding the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy for glucose sensing. Here, we demonstrate the first direct observation of glucose Raman peaks from in vivo skin. The signal intensities varied proportional to the reference glucose concentrations in three live swine glucose clamping experiments. Tracking spectral intensity based on linearity enabled accurate prospective prediction in within-subject and intersubject models. Our direct demonstration of glucose signal may quiet the long debate about whether glucose Raman spectra can be measured in vivo in transcutaneous glucose sensing.

Blood pressure is a primary vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the early detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise {PPG} for estimating blood pressure. Recent advancements in signal processing techniques, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, have also opened up exciting new horizons for {PPG}-based cuff less and continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Such a device will have a significant and transformative impact in monitoring patients’ vital signs, especially those at risk of cardiovascular disease. This paper provides a comprehensive review for non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure estimation using the {PPG} approach along with their challenges and limitations.},

	title = {Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation from Electrocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram Using Waveform Based {ANN}-{LSTM} Network},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02214},
	abstract = {Goal: Although photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) and electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals can be used to estimate blood pressure ({BP}) by extracting various features, the changes in morphological contours of both {PPG} and {ECG} signals due to various diseases of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological systems make the extraction of such features very difficult. Methods: In this work, we propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory ({ANN}-{LSTM}) model for {BP} estimation. The model consists of two hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses {ANNs} to extract necessary morphological features from {ECG} and {PPG} waveforms and the upper hierarchy level uses {LSTM} layers to account for the time domain variation of the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentations ({AAMI}) standard and the British Hypertension Society ({BHS}) standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic blood pressure ({SBP}) and diastolic blood pressure ({DBP}). For the proposed network, the mean absolute error ({MAE}) and the root mean square error ({RMSE}) for {SBP} estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 {mmHg}, respectively, and for {DBP} estimation are 0.58 and 0.85 {mmHg}, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed hierarchical {ANN}-{LSTM} model is found to be better than the other feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain variations to estimate {BP} reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner. Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous {BP} estimation.},

Various studies have proposed cuff-less {BP} monitoring methods using pulse transit time. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture using only raw signals without the process of extracting features to improve the {BP} estimation performance using the attention mechanism. The proposed model consisted of a convolutional neural network, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and an attention mechanism. The model was trained by a calibration-based method, using the data of each subject. The performance of the model was compared to the model that used each combination of the three signals, and the model with the attention mechanism showed better performance than other state-of-the-art methods, including conventional linear regression method using pulse transit time ({PTT}). A total of 15 subjects were recruited, and electrocardiogram, ballistocardiogram, and photoplethysmogram levels were measured. The 95\% confidence interval of the reference {BP} was [86.34, 143.74] and [51.28, 88.74] for systolic {BP} ({SBP}) and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}), respectively.

For this purpose, a database consisting of / a / vowels with different {BP} values under the same room and environment conditions is presented to the literature. Convolutional Neural Networks-Regression ({CNN}-R), Support Vector Machines-Regression ({SVMs}-R) and Multi Linear Regression ({MLR}) are used in this study to predict {BP} with extracted features. In the simulation studies, the highest accuracy rates of {BP} prediction from / a / vowel have been obtained based on Systolic {BP} values with {CNN}-R. The simulation outputs of the study yielded accuracy results in an acceptable margin. In the study, 89.43\% for {MLR}, 92.15\% for {SVM}-R and 93.65\% for {CNN}-R are obtained when {ReliefF} has been used. When the root mean square errors ({RMSE}) are considered, the lowest error rate is obtained with {CNN}-R as {RMSE} = 0.2355. In conclusion, it can be observed that the proposed feature vector ({FVx}) shows a relationship between {BP} and the human voices, and in this direction, it can be used as an {FVx} in a system which will be developed in order to follow the tension of individuals.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for arterial blood pressure ({BP}) estimation directly map the input physiological signals to output {BP} values without explicitly modeling the underlying temporal dependencies in {BP} dynamics. As a result, these models suffer from accuracy decay over a long time and thus require frequent calibration. In this work, we address this issue by formulating {BP} estimation as a sequence prediction problem in which both the input and target are temporal sequences. We propose a novel deep recurrent neural network ({RNN}) consisting of multilayered Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) networks, which are incorporated with (1) a bidirectional structure to access larger-scale context information of input sequence, and (2) residual connections to allow gradients in deep {RNN} to propagate more effectively. The proposed deep {RNN} model was tested on a static {BP} dataset, and it achieved root mean square error ({RMSE}) of 3.90 and 2.66 {mmHg} for systolic {BP} ({SBP}) and diastolic {BP} ({DBP}) prediction respectively, surpassing the accuracy of traditional {BP} prediction models. On a multi-day {BP} dataset, the deep {RNN} achieved {RMSE} of 3.84, 5.25, 5.80 and 5.81 {mmHg} for the 1st day, 2nd day, 4th day and 6th month after the 1st day {SBP} prediction, and 1.80, 4.78, 5.0, 5.21 {mmHg} for corresponding {DBP} prediction, respectively, which outperforms all previous models with notable improvement.

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques combined with wearable electronics can deliver accurate short-term blood glucose level prediction models. These models can learn personalized glucose-insulin dynamics based on the sensor data collected by monitoring several aspects of the physiological condition and daily activity of an individual. Until now, the prevalent approach for developing data-driven prediction models was to collect as much data as possible to help physicians and patients optimally adjust therapy. The objective of this work was to investigate the minimum data variety, volume, and velocity required to create accurate person-centric short-term prediction models. We developed a series of these models using different machine learning time series forecasting techniques suitable for execution within a wearable processor. We conducted an extensive passive patient monitoring study in real-world conditions to build an appropriate data set. The study involved a subset of type 1 diabetic subjects wearing a flash glucose monitoring system. We comparatively and quantitatively evaluated the performance of the developed data-driven prediction models and the corresponding machine learning techniques. Our results indicate that very accurate short-term prediction can be achieved by only monitoring interstitial glucose data over a very short time period and using a low sampling frequency. The models developed can predict glucose levels within a 15-min horizon with an average error as low as 15.43 mg/{dL} using only 24 historic values collected within a period of sex hours, and by increasing the sampling frequency to include 72 values, the average error is reduced to 10.15 mg/{dL}. Our prediction models are suitable for execution within a wearable device, requiring the minimum hardware requirements while at simultaneously achieving very high prediction accuracy.},

This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of a machine-learning-based prediction model to anticipate {NH} in T1D patients on {MDI}. (2) Methods: ten T1D adults were studied during 12 weeks. Information regarding T1D management, continuous glucose monitoring ({CGM}), and from a physical activity tracker were obtained under free-living conditions at home. Supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied to the data, and prediction models were created to forecast the occurrence of {NH}. Individualized prediction models were generated using multilayer perceptron ({MLP}) and a support vector machine ({SVM}). (3) Results: population outcomes indicated that more than 70\% of the {NH} may be avoided with the proposed methodology. The predictions performed by the {SVM} achieved the best population outcomes, with a sensitivity and specificity of 78.75\% and 82.15\%, respectively.

Many studies using lung sounds recorded with stethoscope have been conducted in the literature in order to diagnose the lung diseases with artificial intelligence-compatible devices and to assist the experts in their diagnosis. In this paper, {ICBHI} 2017 database which includes different sample frequencies, noise and background sounds was used for the classification of lung sounds. The lung sound signals were initially converted to spectrogram images by using time–frequency method. The short time Fourier transform ({STFT}) method was considered as time–frequency transformation. Two deep learning based approaches were used for lung sound classification. In the first approach, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) model was used for feature extraction and a support vector machine ({SVM}) classifier was used in classification of the lung sounds. In the second approach, the pre-trained deep {CNN} model was fine-tuned (transfer learning) via spectrogram images for lung sound classification. The accuracies of the proposed methods were tested by using the ten-fold cross validation. The accuracies for the first and second proposed methods were 65.5\% and 63.09\%, respectively. The obtained accuracies were then compared with some of the existing results and it was seen that obtained scores were better than the other results.},

	abstract = {We propose a robust and efficient lung sound classification system using a snapshot ensemble of convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). A robust {CNN} architecture is used to extract high-level features from log mel spectrograms. The {CNN} architecture is trained on a cosine cycle learning rate schedule. Capturing the best model of each training cycle allows to obtain multiple models settled on various local optima from cycle to cycle at the cost of training a single mode. Therefore, the snapshot ensemble boosts performance of the proposed system while keeping the drawback of expensive training of ensembles moderate. To deal with the class-imbalance of the dataset, temporal stretching and vocal tract length perturbation ({VTLP}) for data augmentation and the focal loss objective are used. Empirically, our system outperforms state-of-the-art systems for the prediction task of four classes (normal, crackles, wheezes, and both crackles and wheezes) and two classes (normal and abnormal (i.e. crackles, wheezes, and both crackles and wheezes)) and achieves 78.4\% and 83.7\% {ICBHI} specific micro-averaged accuracy, respectively. The average accuracy is repeated on ten random splittings of 80\% training and 20\% testing data using the {ICBHI} 2017 dataset of respiratory cycles.},

Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared ({NIR}) Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) combined with machine-learning regression ({MLR}).

A novel piece-wise linear ({PWL}) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the {FGSVR} on-chip. The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm {CMOS} process with a chip area of 4.0 mm2 while consuming 1.62 {mW}. The glucose measurements are performed for 200 subjects with R2 of 0.937.

In this paper, we developed a portable system that makes near-infrared spectroscopy ({NIRS}) technology available to non-professionals through a mobile application and a specially-made enclosure. It overcomes the shortcomings of traditional spectroscopy systems, such as large volume, high cost, complicated operation, and difficulty in online detection. To verify the feasibility of {NIRS} in noninvasive blood glucose concentration detection, after the pretreatment of the acquired original spectra, we compared two different feature extraction algorithms of synergy interval (Si) and genetic algorithm ({GA}). On this basis, two quantitative prediction models of partial least squares ({PLS}) and extreme learning machine ({ELM}) were established. The experimental results showed the model based on the combination of Si and {GA} and {ELM} (i.e., Si-{GA}-{ELM} model) as the most accurate among the selected models. At the same time, the prediction accuracy of the spectral waveband was higher than that of the full. To further overcome the difficulty of establishing a finite sample data model and reduce the influence of individual differences, the model transfer method {TrAdaBoost} was used to enhance the accuracy and stability of our model. The final experimental results show that the {NIR} spectrometer used is portable and light and can be encased as a handheld device form. Computation models combining machine learning and chemometric methods make the estimated blood glucose more feasible, which is an innovative work in noninvasive blood glucose measurement fields.},

A portable embedded system for taking photoacoustic measurements on tissues to estimate glucose concentration is implemented using field programmable gate array ({FPGA}). The back-end architecture for high-speed data acquisition and de-noising of photoacoustic measurements operates at 274.823 {MHz} on a Xilinx Virtex-{II} Pro {FPGA}. The glucose measurement technique is verified in vitro on glucose solutions and in vivo on tissues, with photoacoustic signal amplitude varying linearly with sample glucose concentration. A kernel-based regression algorithm using multiple features of the photoacoustic signal is used to estimate glucose concentration from photoacoustic measurements. The calibration algorithm provides a superior performance over previous efforts with a mean absolute relative difference of 8.84\% and Clarke Error Grid distribution of 92.86\% and 7.14\% over Zones A and B of the grid. A cloud computing platform for automated monitoring of blood glucose levels is proposed to enable individuals with diabetes to connect with doctors and caretakers.

	abstract = {Non-invasive diabetes prediction has been gaining prominence over the last decade. Among many human serums evaluated, human breath emerges as a promising option with acetone levels in breath exhibiting a good correlation to blood glucose levels. Such correlation establishes acetone as an acceptable biomarker for diabetes. The most common data analysis strategies to analyze the biomarkers in breath for disease detection use feature extraction and classification algorithms. However, snags such as computational cost and lack of optimal feature selection on application to real-time signals reduce the efficiency of such analysis. This paper explores the use of a one-dimensional (1-D) modified convolution neural network ({CNN}) algorithm that combines feature extraction and classification techniques. The approach proposed in this paper is found to significantly reduce the limitations associated with using these techniques individually and thereby improving the classifier's performance further. This paper proposes to apply a modified 1-D {CNN} on real-time breath signals obtained from an array of gas sensors. The experimentation and the performance of the system is carried out and evaluated.},

However, the pain sensation due to finger pricking is not only an inconvenience to patients, but can also reduce compliance with diabetes management. A reliable, mobile, easy-to-use, and noninvasive glucometer can address this problem. Noninvasive optical signals, such as those used to obtain a photoplethysmogram ({PPG}), have recently been used to measure human physiological and vascular conditions and have been adopted to estimate glucose. In this study, we conducted a clinical trial to acquire the {PPG} signals using wearable devices from nine type 2 diabetic patients. The global and personalized models were built using random forest and adaboost regression models. The accuracy of the models was determined by the tenfold cross validation and leave-one-out validation approaches. The results show that it is feasible to attain 90\% accurate glucose predictions. Therefore, diabetic patients can use a wearable noninvasive glucometer utilizing the {PPG} signals.},

	abstract = {Inferring abnormal glucose events such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia is crucial for the health of both diabetic patients and non-diabetic people. However, regular blood glucose monitoring can be invasive and inconvenient in everyday life. We present {SugarMate}, a first smartphone-based blood glucose inference system as a temporary alternative to continuous blood glucose monitors ({CGM}) when they are uncomfortable or inconvenient to wear. In addition to the records of food, drug and insulin intake, it leverages smartphone sensors to measure physical activities and sleep quality automatically. Provided with the imbalanced and often limited measurements, a challenge of {SugarMate} is the inference of blood glucose levels at a fine-grained time resolution. We propose Md3RNN, an efficient learning paradigm to make full use of the available blood glucose information. Specifically, the newly designed grouped input layers, together with the adoption of a deep {RNN} model, offer an opportunity to build blood glucose models for the general public based on limited personal measurements from single-user and grouped-users perspectives. Evaluations on 112 users demonstrate that Md3RNN yields an average accuracy of 82.14\%, significantly outperforming previous learning methods those are either shallow, generically structured, or oblivious to grouped behaviors. Also, a user study with the 112 participants shows that {SugarMate} is acceptable for practical usage.},

The goal of the study is to develop a device that can monitor the blood glucose level that would not cause any discomfort to the patients by utilizing reflectance mode photoplethysmography equipped with a filtering technique, Moving Average filter. Initially, the device prompts the user to choose from two categories depending on his condition: diabetic or non-diabetic, and then would choose between the two modes: fasting or post meal mode. The parameters utilized in the study are the force in Newton (N) which corresponds to the applied pressure on the finger, the peak-to-peak voltage (V) of the photopletyhsmography signal, and lastly, the blood glucose level measured in milligram per deciliter (mg/{dL}). The force is acquired using a force sensitive resistor that is incorporated in the ring. The suggested device employs a photoplethysmography sensor which can diagnose variations on microvascular bed of tissue. The variations in the distribution of blood volume have a significant relation with the measurement of blood glucose level. The technique used to estimate the photoplethysmography in terms of peak-to-peak voltage is the Moving Average filter, and the result is then compared to that of the {OneTouch} glucometer and Fasting Plasma Glucose. From the results acquired, two equations are derived which output the blood glucose level for diabetic and non-diabetic patients in mg/{dL}. The equations are described to be both linear, a positive correlation for non-diabetic patients with a percentage of 70.3004\% and a negative correlation for the diabetic with a percentage of 91.9226\%.},

	abstract = {Objective
Continuous monitoring of blood glucose concentrations ({BGC}) is a crucial and integrated part of diabetes management. The most widely used glucose monitoring devices are blood glucose meters based on minimally-invasive finger-stick tests. The recent trend, however, is shifting towards non-invasive glucose monitoring ({NGM}) technology, as it alleviates the pain of frequently prick on patients’ skin. In {NGM} technology, it is difficult to establish a universal model that meets the clinical requirements in accuracy due to the individual differences in granularity, e.g., skin thickness, blood volume, body fat, etc. How to reduce the influence of individual differences on {NGM} is a technical difficulty. This study aims to propose a framework and a model-level solution for {NGM} while improving accuracy.
Methods
An optical {NGM} prototype is developed, and 4012 samples from 89 patients are collected by clinical trials. By clustering these samples using a fuzzy c-means algorithm, we found that human pulse waveforms can be roughly divided into four types, corresponding to four different physique characteristics, which reflect the individual differences to some extent. Based on this discovery, we propose a Physique-based Fuzzy Granular modeling ({PbFG}) framework, in which four granular glucose estimators are used to predict {BGC} values, and a fuzzy physique classifier is applied to classify user’s physique. The final {BGC} value is then obtained by fusing the four granular {BGC} values with the fuzzy physique classification results.
Results
Using four practical machine learning algorithms as the {BGC} estimators, the {PbFG} framework is clinically evaluated and compared to the universal modeling framework. Our experimental results show that the {PbFG} raises the squared correlation coefficient (R2) between the {NGM} prototype and other invasive reference devices to 0.851 from 0.812. Following Clarke Error Grid Analysis ({EGA}), more than 97.9\% of the measurement points are in region A (74.1\%) and B (23.8\%). In individual-customized modeling analysis, the {PbFG} can make the R2 reach to 0.9 after merely 30 times of calibration.
Conclusions
Both the accuracy and the {EGA} experimental results indicate that our proposed {PbFG} solution can reduce the influence of individual differences to a certain extent, and improve the performance of {NGM} to a clinically acceptable level.},

	abstract = {Electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin provides a new route for noninvasive glucose monitoring without painful blood collection. However, sweat-based glucose sensing still faces many challenges, such as difficulty in sweat collection, activity variation of glucose oxidase due to lactic acid secretion and ambient temperature changes, and delamination of the enzyme when exposed to mechanical friction and skin deformation. Precise point-of-care therapy in response to the measured glucose levels is still very challenging. We present a wearable/disposable sweat-based glucose monitoring device integrated with a feedback transdermal drug delivery module. Careful multilayer patch design and miniaturization of sensors increase the efficiency of the sweat collection and sensing process. Multimodal glucose sensing, as well as its real-time correction based on {pH}, temperature, and humidity measurements, maximizes the accuracy of the sensing. The minimal layout design of the same sensors also enables a strip-type disposable device. Drugs for the feedback transdermal therapy are loaded on two different temperature-responsive phase change nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are embedded in hyaluronic acid hydrogel microneedles, which are additionally coated with phase change materials. This enables multistage, spatially patterned, and precisely controlled drug release in response to the patient’s glucose level. The system provides a novel closed-loop solution for the noninvasive sweat-based management of diabetes mellitus.

Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram ({ECG})-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw {ECG} signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the {ECG} signal (e.g., T-wave, {ST}-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods.

	abstract = {Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ({DM}1) patients are used to checking their blood glucose levels several times per day through finger sticks and, by subjectively handling this information, to try to predict their future glycaemia in order to choose a proper strategy to keep their glucose levels under control, in terms of insulin dosages and other factors. However, recent Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring ({CGM}) so that, with the proper Machine Learning ({ML}) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an \&lsquo;on-the-fly\&rsquo; approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, {CGM} study has been carried out with 25 {DM}1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error ({RMSE}) of 11.65 mg/{dL} in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an {RMSE} of 19.90 mg/{dL}. Thus, this paper concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system which estimates blood glucose level ({BGL}) by non-invasive method using Photoplethysmography ({PPG}). Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the {PPG} signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a {PPG} signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of {BGL} values. A {PPG} data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. {BGL} value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and {BGL} value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of {BGL} value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R2 = 0.81. Further, {BGL} estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for {BGL} estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6\% in class A and 17.4\% in class B. 1\% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique ({SPA}) the distribution of data samples are 83\% in class A and 17\% in class B. The proposed features in {SPA} have shown significant improvement in R2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. {SPA} technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a global health problem caused primarily by the inability of pancreatic β-cells to secrete adequate levels of insulin. The molecular mechanisms underlying the progressive failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in type-2 diabetes remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic βV59M mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in {NADH} and {ATP} are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. {INS}-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and {ATP} synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of β-cells in diabetes.},

We present a phenylboronic acid ({PBA})-based {HEMA} contact lens that exhibits a reversible swelling/shrinking effect to change its thickness. The difference in thickness can be detected in a picture taken with a smartphone and analyzed using software.

Audio signal includes music, speech and environmental sounds. Over the last few decades, audio signal processing has grown significantly in terms of signal analysis and classification. And it has been proven that solutions of many existing issues can be solved by integrating the modern machine learning ({ML}) algorithms with the audio signal processing techniques. The performance of any {ML} algorithm depends on the features on which the training and testing is done. Hence feature extraction is one of the most vital part of a machine learning process. The aim of this study is to summarize the literature of the audio signal processing specially focusing on the feature extraction techniques. In this survey the temporal domain, frequency domain, cepstral domain, wavelet domain and time-frequency domain features are discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {The increasing popularity of autonomous and remotely-piloted drones have paved the way for several use-cases, e.g., merchandise delivery and surveillance. In many scenarios, estimating with zero-touch the weight of the payload carried by a drone before its physical approach could be attractive, e.g., to provide an early tampering detection. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to remotely detect the weight of the payload carried by a commercial drone by analyzing its acoustic fingerprint. We characterize the difference in the thrust needed by the drone to carry different payloads, resulting in significant variations of the related acoustic fingerprint. We applied the above findings to different use-cases, characterized by different computational capabilities of the detection system. Results are striking: using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients ({MFCC}) components of the audio signal and different Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) classifiers, we achieved a minimum classification accuracy of 98\% in the detection of the specific payload class carried by the drone, using an acquisition time of 0.25 s---performances improve when using longer time acquisitions. All the data used for our analysis have been released as open-source, to enable the community to validate our findings and use such data as a ready-to-use basis for further investigations.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces originated by a drone running the widespread {ArduCopter} open-source firmware, currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones. Then, we tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that {PiNcH} can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii) discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced upper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The effectiveness of {PiNcH} has been also evaluated in the presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case, the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-{RC} link to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, {PiNcH} continues enjoying a remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art solution confirms the superior performance of {PiNcH} in several scenarios. Note that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality and viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination, and pave the way for future research in the area.},

	abstract = {The combination of traditional cloud computing and mobile computing leads to the novel paradigm of mobile cloud computing. Due to the mobility of network nodes in mobile cloud computing, security has been a challenging problem of paramount importance. When a mobile cloud involves heterogeneous client networks, such as Wireless Sensor Networks and Vehicular Networks, the security problem becomes more challenging because the client networks often have different security requirements in terms of computational complexity, power consumption, and security levels. To securely collect and fuse the data from heterogeneous client networks in complex systems of this kind, novel security schemes need to be devised. Intrusion detection is one of the key security functions in mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client networks. A variety of different rule-based intrusion detection methods could be employed in this type of systems. However, the existing intrusion detection schemes lead to high computation complexity or require frequent rule updates, which seriously harms their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based intrusion detection scheme for mobile clouds involving heterogeneous client networks. The proposed scheme does not require rule updates and its complexity can be customized to suit the requirements of the client networks. Technically, the proposed scheme includes two steps: multi-layer traffic screening and decision-based Virtual Machine ({VM}) selection. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme is highly effective in terms of intrusion detection.},

	abstract = {Most deployed intrusion detection systems ({IDSs}) follow a signature-based approach where attacks are identified by matching each input event against predefined signatures that model malicious activity. This matching process accounts for the most resource intensive task of an {IDS}. Many systems perform the matching by comparing each input event to all rules sequentially. This is far from being optimal. Although sometimes ad-hoc optimizations are utilized, no general solution to this problem has been proposed so far.This paper describes an approach where machine learning clustering techniques are applied to improve the matching process. Given a set of signatures (each dictating a number of constraints the input data must fulfill to trigger it) an algorithm generates a decision tree that is used to find malicious events using as few redundant comparisons as possible.This general idea has been applied to a network-based {IDS}. In particular, a system has been implemented that replaces the detection engine of Snort [14,16]. Experimental evaluation shows that the speed of the detection process has been significantly improved, even compared to Snort’s recently released, fully revised detection engine.},

The early research work in this area and commercially available Intrusion Detection Systems ({IDS}) are mostly signature-based. The problem of signature based method is that the database signature needs to be updated as new attack signatures become available and therefore it is not suitable for the real-time network anomaly detection. The recent trend in anomaly detection is based on machine learning classification techniques. We apply seven different machine learning techniques with information entropy calculation to Kyoto 2006+ data set and evaluate the performance of these techniques. Our findings show that, for this particular data set, most machine learning techniques provide higher than 90\% precision, recall and accuracy. However, using area under the Receiver Operating Curve ({ROC}) metric, we find that Radial Basis Function ({RBF}) performs the best among the seven algorithms studied in this work.},

In this contribution, we review the current state-of-the-art highlighting how current solutions to respond to drones are completely ineffective against {JAM}-{ME}. In particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the overhead, under very conservative assumptions, {JAM}-{ME} experiences an average overhead of 70\%; however, note that such overhead can be reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in the paper. Finally, we highlight the intrinsic limitations of our solution, potential countermeasures, and new jamming strategies that can pave the way to further research.},

Baseline wander in electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals is one such example, which can be caused by factors such as respiration, variations in electrode impedance, and excessive body movements. Unless baseline wander is effectively removed, the accuracy of any feature extracted from the {ECG}, such as timing and duration of the {ST}-segment, is compromised. This paper approaches this filtering task from a novel standpoint by assuming that the {ECG} baseline wander comes from an independent and unknown source. The technique utilizes a hierarchical method including a blind source separation ({BSS}) step, in particular independent component analysis, to eliminate the effect of the baseline wander. We examine the specifics of the components causing the baseline wander and the factors that affect the separation process. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in removing the baseline wander.},

For the remote authentication, we have adopted the state-of-the-art scheme. We have described the biometric verification method instead of using cryptographic hash function for feature matching. We have used the piecewise aligned morphology ({PAM}) of heartbeat signal as a biometric feature. The biometric verification method was tested with {ECG} records of 100 individuals and 1.34\% of equal error rate ({EER}) was obtained. This feature could be computed and transmitted efficiently using mobile computing devices. The proposed scheme offers more security and convenience to users. Additionally, it becomes robust against noisy biometric input.

	abstract = {Body area networks, including smart sensors, are widely reshaping health applications in the new era of smart cities. To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signalbased biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets . To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-{CNN}) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5\% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-{CNN} algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.},

Commercial products using these traits for biometric identification or authentication are increasingly widespread, from smartphones to border control. However, increasingly smart techniques to counterfeit such traits raise the need for traits that are less vulnerable to stealthy trait measurement or spoofing attacks. This has sparked interest on the electrocardiogram ({ECG}), most commonly associated with medical diagnosis, whose hidden nature and inherent liveness information make it highly resistant to attacks. In the last years, the topic of {ECG}-based biometrics has quickly evolved toward the commercial applications, mainly by addressing the reduced acceptability and comfort by proposing new off-the-person, wearable, and seamless acquisition settings. Furthermore, researchers have recently started to address the issues of spoofing prevention and data security in {ECG} biometrics, as well as the potential of deep learning methodologies to enhance the recognition accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we conduct a deep review and discussion of 93 state-of-the-art publications on their proposed methods, signal datasets, and publicly available {ECG} collections. The extracted knowledge is used to present the fundamentals and the evolution of {ECG} biometrics, describe the current state of the art, and draw conclusions on prior art approaches and current challenges.

	abstract = {In this paper, we proposed 3-level authentication technique to prevent internal information leakage in network system. When system authenticates users, it requires user's {ID}\&P/W firstly. Then, it requires a secondary authentication component to check whether he/she is legitimate user. By doing so, it can implement a more robust authentication system. The secondary authentication components are usually a security card, an encryption key and bio-information such as iris, face, fingerprint etc. But there is a problem related to {ID}\&P/W exposure and bio-information copy. Especially, nobody knows can check whether {ID}\&P/W are exposed, whether bioinformation is copied. So, we propose another authentication way using biometric signals. A biometric signal is essentially a pattern recognition factor that operates by acquiring biometric signals from an individual, extracting a feature set from the acquired signal pattern, and comparing this feature set against the template set in the database. We decided to use skin conductivity in the biometric signals as 3rd authentication element. The skin conductivity is used as an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. So, there is no risk because it never exposes or copies.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. The electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is a non-invasive technique widely used for the detection of cardiac diseases. To increase diagnostic sensitivity, {ECG} is acquired during exercise stress tests or in an ambulatory way. Under these acquisition conditions, the {ECG} is strongly affected by some types of noise, mainly by baseline wander ({BLW}). In this work were implemented nine methods widely used for the elimination of {BLW}, which are: interpolation using cubic splines, {FIR} filter, {IIR} filter, least mean square adaptive filtering, moving-average filter, independent component analysis, interpolation and successive subtraction of median values in {RR} interval, empirical mode decomposition and wavelet filtering. For the quantitative evaluation, the following similarity metrics were used: absolute maximum distance, the sum of squares of distances and percentage root-mean-square difference. Several experiments were performed using synthetic {ECG} signals generated by {ECGSYM} software, real {ECG} signals from {QT} Database, artificial {BLW} generated by software and real {BLW} from the Noise Stress Test Database. The best results were obtained by the method based on {FIR} high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.67 Hz.},

In order to pursue this research, it was necessary to verify the quality of the data produced by the E4 device against a device currently used by clinicians to detect atrial fibrillation. This was done by having healthy volunteers wear both the Empatica E4 and the clinician standard device while following standard clinician procedure for atrial fibrillation diagnosis. The device was compared qualitatively against General Electric's {SEER} Light Extend Recorder holter portable electrocardiogram. The analysis was done by non-experts at varying academic levels. The primary reviewer's results showed similar data quality between both devices 85\% of the time and the holter performed better 5\% of the time.},

	abstract = {Objective: Recent technological advances have led to the proliferation of ambulatory devices for non-invasively assessing cardiac activity. While these devices have exciting implications for conducting research outside the laboratory, it is critical that this increased mobility does not compromise data quality. As a test case, we assess the efficacy of Empatica’s E4, a high-end wristband device designed to assess Heart Rate Variability ({HRV}) through the use of photoplethysmography. Approach: We compare the E4 to traditional, wired electrocardiogram measures across a variety of conditions, including seated, supine, and standing baselines, as well as typing and grip strength tasks. Most importantly, we introduce and demonstrate the efficacy of a new method for determining the amount of error in {HRV} estimates derived from the E4 and a technique for adjusting error tolerance. Main Results: Results indicate that the E4 is severely compromised by motion artifact, resulting in a high percentage of missing data across all conditions except seated and supine baselines. Employing error adjustment yielded more robust results, but at the cost of significantly reducing sample size where motion artifact was present. Significance: These results call into question the wristband’s efficacy as an {HRV} measurement tool in most in-vivo conditions. We recommend that researchers interested in using photoplethysmography-based {HRV} devices use caution and evaluate the data quality using methods for error detection and tolerance, such as the one presented here.Keywords: heart rate variability, ambulatory photoplethysmography, electrocardiogram.},

	doi = {10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397608},
	abstract = {Biometric systems suffer from a fundamental vulnerability to presentation attacks which impairs their security and robustness. To overcome this issue, liveness detection methods have been introduced to ensure that input data is originating from a live human being, and it is not forged from old or artificial data. In case of fingerprint and face image-two of the most widely used traits in biometric systems-liveness detection methods attempts to detect fake input data such as gummy finger or finger image in the former, and printed face image or masks in the latter. A new trend in liveness detection methods is moving toward using bio-electrical signals such as Electrocardiography ({ECG}) and Electroencephalography ({EEG}). These signals are believed to have an intrinsic liveness property due to the point that they can only be obtained when a live human subject is present. However this is not a realistic assumption, since in recent works these signals have been artificially crafted, and gotten accepted by biometric systems. Therefore, similar to other traits, liveness detection methods for bio-electrical signals need to be developed, and, furthermore new approaches to liveness detection should be studied. In this paper, we discuss liveness detection challenges, and trade-offs with respect to factors such as usability, cost, and performance, and necessary requirements for an evaluation criteria is specified. Finally, the current state of art in liveness detection methods are comprehensively evaluated using the developed criteria.},

	doi = {10.1055/a-0631-0920},
	abstract = {Purpose Traditional heart-rate monitoring through the use of electrocardiograms or chest-worn heart rate sensors can be challenging in certain sports or in field settings. New technologies, such as photoplethysmography ({PPG}), have enabled heart-rate monitoring at alternate sites. However, to date, the accuracy and validity of various {PPG} sensors has not been examined in detail. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the validity of an arm-worn {PPG} sensor during yoga sequences.
Methods Fifteen college-aged men and women participated in a {\textasciitilde}45 min power vinyasa yoga class. During the class, participants wore Polar® H7 chest straps and {RCX}3 receivers (criterion) and Polar® {OH}1 arm bands on their upper right arm (practical). Mean differences were compared via a paired t-test, heart rate during yoga using a time*device repeated measures {ANOVA}, and agreement assessed with Bland-Altman analysis.
Results Mean heart rates during yoga were not different (mean difference=0.76, 95\% {CI}: –0.54 to 2.06; p=0.229). Yoga created a main effect of time on heart rate (p{\textless}0.0001), but there was no difference between devices (p=0.86) or interaction (p=0.90). Mean bias±95\% limits of agreement was 0.76±1.30 bpm, with a typical error of 2.42±1.49 bpm and a coefficient of variation of 1.8±1.5\%.
Conclusions Results of the present investigation revealed that the Polar® {OH}1 is a valid measure of heart rate during moderate-vigorous exercise. Future validation studies should consider other exercise modes and participant characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background Optical measurement techniques and recent advances in wearable technology have made heart rate ({HR}) sensing simpler and more affordable. Objectives The Polar {OH}1 is an arm worn optical heart rate monitor. The objectives of this study are two-fold; 1) to validate the {OH}1 optical {HR} sensor with the gold standard of {HR} measurement, electrocardiography ({ECG}), over a range of moderate to high intensity physical activities, 2) to validate wearing the {OH}1 at the temple as an alternative location to its recommended wearing location around the forearm and upper arm. Methods Twenty-four individuals participated in a physical exercise protocol, by walking on a treadmill and riding a stationary spin bike at different speeds while the criterion measure, {ECG} and Polar {OH}1 {HR} were recorded simultaneously at three different body locations; forearm, upper arm and the temple. Time synchronised {HR} data points were compared using Bland-Altman analyses and intraclass correlation. Results The intraclass correlation between the {ECG} and Polar {OH}1, for the aggregated data, was 0.99 and the estimated mean bias ranged 0.27–0.33 bpm for the sensor locations. The three sensors exhibited a 95\% limit of agreement ({LoA}: forearm 5.22, -4.68 bpm; upper arm 5.15, -4.49; temple 5.22, -4.66). The mean of the {ECG} {HR} for the aggregated data was 112.15 ± 24.52 bpm. The intraclass correlation of {HR} values below and above this mean were 0.98 and 0.99 respectively. The reported mean bias ranged 0.38–0.47 bpm (95\% {LoA}: forearm 6.14, -5.38 bpm; upper arm 6.07, -5.13 bpm; temple 6.09, -5.31 bpm), and 0.15–0.16 bpm (95\% {LoA}: forearm 3.99, -3.69 bpm; upper arm 3.90, -3.58 bpm; temple 4.06, -3.76 bpm) respectively. During different exercise intensities, the intraclass correlation ranged 0.95–0.99 for the three sensor locations. During the entire protocol, the estimated mean bias was in the range -0.15–0.55 bpm, 0.01–0.53 bpm and -0.37–0.48 bpm, for the forearm, upper arm and temple locations respectively. The corresponding upper limits of 95\% {LoA} were 3.22–7.03 bpm, 3.25–6.82 bpm and 3.18–7.04 bpm while the lower limits of 95\% {LoA} were -6.36–(-2.35) bpm, -6.46–(-2.30) bpm and -7.42–(-2.41) bpm. Conclusion Polar {OH}1 demonstrates high level of agreement with the criterion measure {ECG} {HR}, thus can be used as a valid measure of {HR} in lab and field settings during moderate and high intensity physical activities.},

The organization has to spend a generous amount of resources to protect the information from the intruders. Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of the network applications to have unauthorized access to organizational information.

In this paper we will be discussing one such type of design level vulnerability that is {ARP} Spoofing. {ARP} Spoofing has been used to perform many types of attacks, including session hijacking, and cookie hijacking. We have used Snort for detecting {ARP} Spoofing. Performance of the snort for detecting {ARP} Spoofing has been studied experimentally on a real network by varying number of the target.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the performance of two open source intrusion detection systems ({IDSs}) namely Snort and Suricata for accurately detecting the malicious traffic on computer networks. Snort and Suricata were installed on two different but identical computers and the performance was evaluated at 10 Gbps network speed. It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of network traffic than Snort with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher computational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus selected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a high rate of false positive alarms. To solve this problem a Snort adaptive plug-in was developed. To select the best performing algorithm for Snort adaptive plug-in, an empirical study was carried out with different learning algorithms and Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) was selected. A hybrid version of {SVM} and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy. But the best result was achieved using an optimised {SVM} with firefly algorithm with {FPR} (false positive rate) as 8.6\% and {FNR} (false negative rate) as 2.2\%, which is a good result. The novelty of this work is the performance comparison of two {IDSs} at 10 Gbps and the application of hybrid and optimised machine learning algorithms to Snort.},

The main objective of this work is to build machine learning models to identify attacks in {IoT} network. To build a model, normal and attack data needs to be generated from the {IoT} environment. A test bed is build to simulate the {IoT} environment using Node {MCU} {ESP}8266, {DHT}11 sensor and wireless router. An adversarial system is build using a laptop system which performs actions of sniffing and poisoning attacks. Data captured from the sensors were temperature, humidity and due-point which are transmitted to {ThinkSpeak} platform using wireless gateway. In the normal phase, sensor values is captured by Node {MCU} and transmitted to Think Speak server which are stored and labelled as normal data. In the attacking phase, from an adversarial system, the attacker secretly intercepts the data, modifies the data when it is transmitted between the Node {MCU} and Think Speak server. In the attacking phase, Man in the Middle attack is performed in the network using {ARP} Poisoning and the data captured is labelled as attack data. Machine learning classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, {SVM}, decision tree, Adaboost are built to categorize data into normal and attack classes.},

	abstract = {Pulse oximetry has been extensively used to estimate oxygen saturation in blood, a vital physiological parameter commonly used when monitoring a subject's health status. However, accurate estimation of this parameter is difficult to achieve when the fundamental signal from which it is derived, the photoplethysmograph ({PPG}), is contaminated with noise artifact induced by movement of the subject or the measurement apparatus. This study presents a novel method for automatic rejection of artifact contaminated pulse oximetry waveforms, based on waveform morphology analysis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually annotated gold standard. The creation of the gold standard involved two experts identifying sections of the {PPG} signal containing good quality {PPG} pulses and/or noise, in 104 fingertip {PPG} signals, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph ({ECG}) signal as a reference signal. The fingertip {PPG} signals were each 1 min in duration and were acquired from 13 healthy subjects (10 males and 3 females). Each signal contained approximately 20 s of purposely induced artifact noise from a variety of activities involving subject movement. Some unique waveform morphology features were extracted from the {PPG} signals, which were believed to be correlated with signal quality. A simple decision-tree classifier was employed to arrive at a classification decision, at a pulse-by-pulse resolution, of whether a pulse was of acceptable quality for use or not. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measures. A mean κ of 0.64 ± 0.22 was obtained, while the mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89 ± 10\%, 77 ± 19\% and 83 ± 11\%, respectively. Furthermore, a heart rate estimate, extracted from uncontaminated sections of {PPG}, as identified by the algorithm, was compared with the heart rate derived from an uncontaminated simultaneous {ECG} signal. The mean error between both heart rate readings was 0.49 ± 0.66 beats per minute ({BPM}), in comparison to an error value observed without using the artifact detection algorithm of 7.23 ± 5.78 {BPM}. These results demonstrate that automated identification of signal artifact in the {PPG} signal through waveform morphology analysis is achievable. In addition, a clear improvement in the accuracy of the derived heart rate is also evident when such methods are employed.},

This is a severe problem in particular for security-sensitive facilities if an adversary could obtain unauthorized privileges after a user's initial login. Recently, continuous user authentication ({CA}) has shown its great potential by enabling seamless user authentication with few active participation. We devise a low-cost system exploiting a user's pulsatile signals from the photoplethysmography ({PPG}) sensor in commercial wrist-worn wearables for {CA}. Compared to existing approaches, our system requires zero user effort and is applicable to practical scenarios with non-clinical {PPG} measurements having motion artifacts ({MA}). We explore the uniqueness of the human cardiac system and design an {MA} filtering method to mitigate the impacts of daily activities. Furthermore, we identify general fiducial features and develop an adaptive classifier using the gradient boosting tree ({GBT}) method. As a result, our system can authenticate users continuously based on their cardiac characteristics so little training effort is required. Experiments with our wrist-worn {PPG} sensing platform on 20 participants under practical scenarios demonstrate that our system can achieve a high {CA} accuracy of over 90\% and a low false detection rate of 4\% in detecting random attacks.},

Notably, we design a robust motion artifacts ({MA}) removal method to mitigate the impact of {MA} from wrist movements. Additionally, we explore the characteristic fiducial features from {PPG} measurements to efficiently distinguish the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree ({GBT}). Experiments with the prototype of the wrist-worn {PPG} sensing platform and 10 participants in different scenarios demonstrate that our system can effectively remove {MA} and achieve a high average authentication success rate over \$90\%\$.},

	doi = {10.23919/EUSIPCO.2018.8553585},
	abstract = {Whilst research efforts have traditionally focused on Electrocardiographic ({ECG}) signals and handcrafted features as potential biometric traits, few works have explored systems based on the raw pho-toplethysmogram ({PPG}) signal. This work proposes an end-to-end architecture to offer biometric authentication using {PPG} biosensors through Convolutional Networks. We provide an evaluation of the performance of our approach in two different databases: Troika and {PulseID}, the latter a publicly available database specifically collected by the authors for such a purpose. Our verification approach through convolutional network based models and using raw {PPG} signals appears to be viable in current monitoring procedures within e-health and fitness environments showing a remarkable potential as a biometry. The approach tested on a verification fashion, on trials lasting one second, achieved an {AUC} of 78.2\% and 83.2\%, averaged among target subjects, on {PulseID} and Troika datasets respectively. Our experimental results on previous small datasets support the usefulness of {PPG} extracted biomarkers as viable traits for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics. Furthermore, the approach results in a low input throughput and complexity that allows for a continuous authentication in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, the reported experiments also suggest that further research is necessary to account for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects.},

During the past few years, several works have been published in order to assess the potential for {PPGs} to be used in biometric authentication systems, but results are inconclusive. In this paper we perform an analysis of the feasibility of using the {PPG} as a realistic biometric alternative in the long term. Several feature extractors (based on the time domain and the Karhunen–Loève transform) and matching metrics (Manhattan and Euclidean distances) have been tested using four different {PPG} databases ({PRRB}, {MIMIC}-{II}, Berry, and Nonin). We show that the false match rate ({FMR}) and false non-match rate ({FNMR}) values remain constant in different time instances for a selected threshold, which is essential for using the {PPG} for biometric authentication purposes. On the other hand, obtained equal error rate ({EER}) values for signals recorded during the same session range from 1.0\% for high-quality signals recorded in controlled conditions to 8\% for those recorded in conditions closer to real-world scenarios. Moreover, in certain scenarios, {EER} values rise up to 23.2\% for signals recorded over different days, signaling that performance degradation could take place with time.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking ({SDN}) is an approach in the network that provides many advantages with the help of separating the intelligence of the network (controller) with the underlying network infrastructure (data plane). But this isolation also gives birth to many security concerns; therefore, the need to protect the network from various attacks is becoming mandatory. Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) in {SDN} is one such attack that is becoming a hurdle to its growth. Before the mitigation of {DDoS} attacks, the primary step is to detect them. In this paper, an early {DDoS} detection tool is created by using {SNORT} {IDS} (Intrusion Detection System). This tool is integrated with popularly used {SDN} controllers (Opendaylight and Open Networking Operating System). For the experimental setup, five different network scenarios are considered. In each scenario number of hosts, switches and data packets vary. For the creation of different hosts, switches the Mininet emulation tool is used whereas for generating the data packets four different penetration tools such as Hping3, Nping, Xerxes, Tor Hammer, {LOIC} are used. The generated data packets are ranging from (50,000 per second–2,50,000 per second) and the number of hosts/switches are ranging from (50–250) in every scenario respectively. The data traffic is bombarded towards the controllers and the evaluation of these packets is achieved by making use of Wireshark. The analysis of our {DDoS} detection system is performed on the basis of various parameters such as time to detect the {DDoS} attack, Round Trip Time ({RTT}), percentage of packet loss and type of {DDoS} attack. It is found that {ODL} takes minimum time to detect the successful {DDoS} attack and more time to go down than {ONOS}. Our tool ensures the timely detection of fast {DDoS} attacks which delivers the better performance of the {SDN} controller and not compromising the overall functionality of the entire network.},

Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect {PPG} signals, developing an optimal signal quality index ({SQI}) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight {SQIs} were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all {PPG} data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each {PPG} signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent {PPG} and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall     F 1     scores of 86.0\%, 87.2\%, and 79.1\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work ``mining'' process. The original Monero protocol was based on {CryptoNote}, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin research irc channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available in {\textbackslash}cite\{Snoe\}.},

	title = {Traceable Ring Signature},

	abstract = {The ring signature allows a signer to leak secrets anonymously, without the risk of identity escrow. At the same time, the ring signature provides great flexibility: No group manager, no special setup, and the dynamics of group choice. The ring signature is, however, vulnerable to malicious or irresponsible signers in some applications, because of its anonymity. In this paper, we propose a traceable ring signature scheme. A traceable ring scheme is a ring signature except that it can restrict ``excessive'' anonymity. The traceable ring signature has a tag that consists of a list of ring members and an issue that refers to, for instance, a social affair or an election. A ring member can make any signed but anonymous opinion regarding the issue, but only once (per tag). If the member submits another signed opinion, possibly pretending to be another person who supports the first opinion, the identity of the member is immediately revealed. If the member submits the same opinion, for instance, voting ``yes'' regarding the same issue twice, everyone can see that these two are linked. The traceable ring signature can suit to many applications, such as an anonymous voting on a {BBS}, a dishonest whistle-blower problem, and unclonable group identification. We formalize the security definitions for this primitive and show an efficient and simple construction.},

This can be done by injecting a malicious javascript code into the website. The malicious javascript code injected utilizes system's resources in order to compute hashes.Most of the classic cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, monero, webchain are built on proof-of-work(pow) algorithm called {CryptoNight}, which is {CPU}-bound. They make use of memorybound functions for constructing computational puzzles [1], in order to maximize profit. This total process requires a lot of disc read and write operations. Hence, we have monitored the cache activity to detect whether cryptojacking exists or not. In addition to detection, our method can also detect the {CPU} percentage throttle set by the attacker making it a multiclass classification problem. We have leveraged a tool called `perf' [2] in order to measure the number of cache hits and misses. Using this methodology, we were able to detect cryptojacking corresponding to each class with an accuracy of 96.25\%.},

We obtained the {PPG} signals from 15 subjects, whom in the experiment were asked to bend their wrist and put it back for several times, continuously. The results of the experiments revealed that a continuous wrist movement of three times achieved an equal error rate of 11.6 \%, and a movement of nine times achieved an equal error rate of 8.8 \%.},

	doi = {10.1109/CNS.2019.8802738},
	abstract = {Smartwatches are expected to become the world's best-selling electronic product after smartphones. Various smart-watches have been released to the private consumer market, but the data on smartwatches is not well protected. In this paper, we show for the first time that photoplethysmography ({PPG})signals influenced by hand gestures can be used to authenticate users on smartwatches. The insight is that muscle and tendon movements caused by hand gestures compress the arterial geometry with different degrees, which has a significant impact on the blood flow. Based on this insight, novel approaches are proposed to detect the starting point and ending point of the hand gesture from raw {PPG} signals and determine if these {PPG} signals are from a normal user or an attacker. Different from existing solutions, our approach leverages the {PPG} sensors that are available on most smartwatches and does not need to collect training data from attackers. Also, our system can be used in more general scenarios wherever users can perform hand gestures and is robust against shoulder surfing attacks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of our system and show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 96.31 \% and an average true rejection rate of at least 91.64\% against two types of attacks.},

	abstract = {Wearable devices in e-Health provide easy usage access as well as an information return to the user. In general, such devices possess a range of sensors that capture several information from both the environment and the user. The most popular information collected by smartwatches and bracelets is about the measurement of heartbeats, steps, oxygenation, and photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) and electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals. These wearable devices rely on mobile devices for user authentication. If the user needs validation, he will resort to traditional methods on other equipment that possesses recognition sensors such as iris, face, or fingerprints. In this paper, we introduce a model for double authentication based on {PPG} and {ECG} signals for promoting another layer of security to the user, ensuring data security, and avoid weak dependence on a single biosignal for validation. The proposed model has a algorithm with two zones, namely the Algorithm for {PPG} and {ECG} Signals and Error Rate zones. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model presented up to 99.98\% of accuracy.},

Network slicing functions will provide an end-to-end isolation between slices with an ability to customize each slice based on the service demands (bandwidth, coverage, security, latency, reliability, etc.). Maintaining isolation of resources, traffic flow, and network functions between the slices is critical in protecting the network infrastructure system from Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) attack. The 5G network demands and new feature sets to support ever-growing and complex business requirements have made existing approaches to network security inadequate. In this paper, we have developed a Neural Network based `Secure5G' Network Slicing model to proactively detect and eliminate threats based on incoming connections before they infest the 5G core network. `Secure5G' is a resilient model that quarantines the threats ensuring end-to-end security from device(s) to the core network, and to any of the external networks. Our designed model will enable the network operators to sell network slicing as-a-service to serve diverse services efficiently over a single infrastructure with high security and reliability.},

To mitigate this threat, there is a need for new methods that detect attacks launched from compromised {IoT} devices and that differentiate between hours- and milliseconds-long {IoT}-based attacks. In this article, we propose a novel network-based anomaly detection method for the {IoT} called N-{BaIoT} that extracts behavior snapshots of the network and uses deep autoencoders to detect anomalous network traffic from compromised {IoT} devices. To evaluate our method, we infected nine commercial {IoT} devices in our lab with two widely known {IoT}-based botnets, Mirai and {BASHLITE}. The evaluation results demonstrated our proposed methods ability to accurately and instantly detect the attacks as they were being launched from the compromised {IoT} devices that were part of a botnet.},

Raw system logs are a prototypical example of streaming data that can quickly scale beyond the cognitive power of a human analyst. As a prospective filter for the human analyst, we present an online unsupervised deep learning approach to detect anomalous network activity from system logs in real time. Our models decompose anomaly scores into the contributions of individual user behavior features for increased interpretability to aid analysts reviewing potential cases of insider threat. Using the {CERT} Insider Threat Dataset v6.2 and threat detection recall as our performance metric, our novel deep and recurrent neural network models outperform Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest based anomaly detection baselines. For our best model, the events labeled as insider threat activity in our dataset had an average anomaly score in the 95.53 percentile, demonstrating our approach's potential to greatly reduce analyst workloads.},

Based on unsupervised training of every layer of {RBM}, we make the output vector of the last layer of {RBM} as the input vectors of {BP} neural network, then conduct supervised training to the {BP} neural network, finally achieve the optimal hybrid model by fine-tuning the entire network.

Although securing a computer network has always been a difficult task, it transmutes into a massive challenge with the exponentially-growing network size and heterogenity in these systems. A recent example in that vein is a major security violation in the form of {DDoS} attacks which were performed by a huge number of {IoT} devices infected with a botnet called "Mirai". Moreover, the role of these devices as control, sensing and communication substrate in critical infrastructures aggravate such problems. Nevertheless, there are some new networking concepts and technologies which promise to offer remedies for the aforementioned challenges; one is software-defined networking ({SDN}) and another one is fog computing, which primarily provide global network control and local services, respectively.

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things ({IoT}), resources' constrained tiny sensors and devices could be connected to unreliable and untrusted networks. Nevertheless, securing {IoT} technology is mandatory, due to the relevant data handled by these devices. Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) is the most efficient technique to detect the attackers with a high accuracy when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection, which are high detection and low false positive rates, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. However, the activation of anomaly detection for low-resource {IoT} devices could generate a high-energy consumption, specifically when this technique is activated all the time. Using game theory and with the help of Nash equilibrium, anomaly detection is activated only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur. This will make a balance between accuracy detection and energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed anomaly detection approach requires a low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high accuracy (i.e. high detection and low false positive rates).},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which resource-constrained objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of {IoT}, make {IoT} vulnerable to different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in {IoT} called sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the {MapReduce} architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19\% and false positive rate of 5.92\% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02\% and 2.08\%, respectively.},

We have developed an ultra-lightweight deep packet anomaly detection approach that is feasible to run on resource constrained {IoT} devices yet provides good discrimination between normal and abnormal payloads. Feature selection uses efficient bit-pattern matching, requiring only a bitwise {AND} operation followed by a conditional counter increment. The discrimination function is implemented as a lookup-table, allowing both fast evaluation and flexible feature space representation. Due to its simplicity, the approach can be efficiently implemented in either hardware or software and can be deployed in network appliances, interfaces, or in the protocol stack of a device. We demonstrate near perfect payload discrimination for data captured from off the shelf {IoT} devices.},

Data collected from {IoT} is usually offloaded to the Cloud which may further leave data prone to a variety of attacks if security and privacy issues are not handled properly. Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to {IoT} and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from {IoT} to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of {IoT} devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing {IoT} data to be stored in different countries with different legislations. This paper, for the first time, presents the challenges and opportunities in anomaly detection for {IoT} and cloud. It first introduces the prominent features and application fields of {IoT} and Cloud, then discusses security and privacy risks to personal information and finally focuses on solutions from anomaly detection perspective.},

Even when they are secured with encryption and authentication, these things are exposed both to wireless attacks from inside the 6LoWPAN network and from the Internet. Since these attacks may succeed, Intrusion Detection Systems ({IDS}) are necessary. Currently, there are no {IDSs} that meet the requirements of the {IPv}6-connected {IoT} since the available approaches are either customized for Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSN}) or for the conventional Internet. In this paper we design, implement, and evaluate a novel intrusion detection system for the {IoT} that we call {SVELTE}. In our implementation and evaluation we primarily target routing attacks such as spoofed or altered information, sinkhole, and selective-forwarding. However, our approach can be extended to detect other attacks. We implement {SVELTE} in the Contiki {OS} and thoroughly evaluate it. Our evaluation shows that in the simulated scenarios, {SVELTE} detects all malicious nodes that launch our implemented sinkhole and/or selective forwarding attacks. However, the true positive rate is not 100\%, i.e., we have some false alarms during the detection of malicious nodes. Also, {SVELTE}’s overhead is small enough to deploy it on constrained nodes with limited energy and memory capacity.},

In such an attack a malicious party tries to either break a service, running on a server, or exhaust the capacity or bandwidth of the victim to hinder customers to effectively use the service. Recent reports show that the total number of Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) attacks is steadily growing with "mega-attacks" peaking at hundreds of gigabit/s (Gbps). In this paper, we will provide a quantification of {DDoS} attacks in size and duration beyond these outliers reported in the media. We find that these mega attacks do exist, but the bulk of attacks is in practice only a fraction of these frequently reported values. We further show that it is feasible to collect meaningful backscatter traces using surprisingly small telescopes, thereby enabling a broader audience to perform attack intelligence research.},

The designed deep models consist of Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) and Long-Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) which are considered to build a user specific model for the verification task. We collected a dataset consisting of 100 participants and recorded at two different time sessions using Plux pulse sensor. This dataset along with another two public databases are deployed to evaluate the performance of the proposed verification system in terms of uniqueness and time stability. The final result demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system tested on the built dataset and compared with other two public databases. The best performance achieved from our collected two-sessions database in terms of accuracy is 98\% for the single-session and 87.1\% for the two-sessions scenarios.},

In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient approach based on adaptive step-size least mean squares ({AS}-{LMS}) adaptive filter for reducing {MA} in corrupted {PPG} signals. The presented method is an extension to our prior work on efficient use of adaptive filters for reduction of {MA} in {PPG} signals. The novelty of the method lies in the fact that a synthetic noise reference signal for an adaptive filtering process, representing {MA} noise, is generated internally from the {MA}-corrupted {PPG} signal itself instead of using any additional hardware such as accelerometer or source-detector pair for acquiring noise reference signal. Thus, the generated noise reference signal is then applied to the {AS}-{LMS} adaptive filter for artifact removal. While experimental results proved the efficacy of the proposed scheme, the merit of the method is clearly demonstrated using convergence and correlation analysis, thus making it best suitable for present-day pulse oximeters utilizing {PPG} sensor head with a single pair of source and detector, which does not have any extra hardware meant for capturing noise reference signal. In addition to arterial oxygen saturation estimation, the artifact reduction method facilitated the waveform contour analysis on artifact-reduced {PPG}, and the conventional parameters were evaluated for assessing the arterial stiffness.},

Due to the unavailability of non-invasive glucose level checker until now, the most trustworthy day-to-day life glucose test for personal healthcare is the use of glucometer in which case painful finger pricking is an obvious part. However, researches have been done to prove the usage of pulse oximeter to measure the blood glucose level besides other physiological indicators such as heart rate, percentage of blood oxygen, etc. Here, as the first of two studies, we try to develop an all-purpose commercial prototype photoplethysmography ({PPG}) system to monitor necessary health indicator parameters in a non-invasive way. The developed fingertip {PPG} device consists of both transmissive and reflective type data acquisition system after illuminating the skin with red, green, and {IR} {LEDs}. Next, as the second study, special consideration is given to prove the efficiency of the device for measuring blood glucose level ({BGL}). To measure blood glucose from {PPG} signal, a few discriminative and related features are extracted from the obtained {PPG} signals. Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict the actual value of {BGL} from the extracted features. The proposed algorithm and system can predict the {BGL} level with a level of clinical accuracy. In the Clarke error grid plot, 96.15\% and 3.85\% of data are in the zone A and zone B, respectively, with 0\% data in the critical zones.},

	abstract = {Among current issues that are challenging to be dealt with in medical science, Diabetes is a noteworthy one. A good number of invasive techniques to measure blood glucose levels have been devised in the past few decades that had been a mixed blessing because it carried multiple limitations along with beneficial sides. Pain, discomfort, and risks of pathogenic infection were some of the basic drawbacks. So, per the demand of time, our main objective of this paper is to introduce a method of blood glucose level measurement that is non-invasive and can overcome the former limitations with better accuracy in a very cost-effective way. Blood glucose concentration can be measured using the {PPG} (Photoplethysmogram) signal. But to gain higher accuracy we need to consider the physiological variations which lead to erroneous measurement of glucose levels. Using {GSR} (Galvanic Skin Response) sensor data, these perturbations can be minimized. So, in our model {PPG} sensor and {GSR} sensor have been used to accurately measure blood glucose levels. Extracted data from these two sensors as well as recorded blood glucose measurement using conventional glucometer were applied in a deep learning algorithm to measure blood glucose level non-invasively. Then the output of our proposed system was compared to conventional invasive technique. The results showed that our proposed multi sensor-based system improves prediction error of glucose level.},

	abstract = {A photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue and is typically collected by pulse oximeters. {PPG} signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect {PPG} signals, developing an optimal signal quality index ({SQI}) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight {SQIs} were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all {PPG} data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each {PPG} signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent {PPG} and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall     F 1     scores of 86.0\%, 87.2\%, and 79.1\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: the use of machine learning techniques for the purpose of anticipating hypoglycemia has increased considerably in the past few years. Hypoglycemia is the drop in blood glucose below critical levels in diabetic patients. This may cause loss of cognitive ability, seizures, and in extreme cases, death. In almost half of all the severe cases, hypoglycemia arrives unannounced and is essentially asymptomatic. The inability of a diabetic patient to anticipate and intervene the occurrence of a hypoglycemic event often results in crisis. Hence, the prediction of hypoglycemia is a vital step in improving the life quality of a diabetic patient. The objective of this paper is to review work performed in the domain of hypoglycemia prediction by using machine learning and also to explore the latest trends and challenges that the researchers face in this area; (2) Methods: literature obtained from {PubMed} and Google Scholar was reviewed. Manuscripts from the last five years were searched for this purpose. A total of 903 papers were initially selected of which 57 papers were eventually shortlisted for detailed review; (3) Results: a thorough dissection of the shortlisted manuscripts provided an interesting split between the works based on two categories: hypoglycemia prediction and hypoglycemia detection. The entire review was carried out keeping this categorical distinction in perspective while providing a thorough overview of the machine learning approaches used to anticipate hypoglycemia, the type of training data, and the prediction horizon.},

	abstract = {Wearable devices have flourished over the past ten years providing great advantages to people and, recently, they have also been used for identity authentication. Most of the authentication methods adopt a one-time authentication manner which cannot provide continuous certification. To address this issue, we present a two-step authentication method based on an own-built fingertip sensor device which can capture motion data (e.g., acceleration and angular velocity) and physiological data (e.g., a photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signal) simultaneously. When the device is worn on the user’s fingertip, it will automatically recognize whether the wearer is a legitimate user or not. More specifically, multisensor data is collected and analyzed to extract representative and intensive features. Then, human activity recognition is applied as the first step to enhance the practicability of the authentication system. After correctly discriminating the motion state, a one-class machine learning algorithm is applied for identity authentication as the second step. When a user wears the device, the authentication process is carried on automatically at set intervals. Analyses were conducted using data from 40 individuals across various operational scenarios. Extensive experiments were executed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieved an average accuracy rate of 98.5\% and an F1-score of 86.67\%. Our results suggest that the proposed scheme provides a feasible and practical solution for authentication.},

Different organizations have put into place a range of technologies, hardware, and/or software to authenticate users using fingerprints, iris recognition, and so forth. However, cost and reliability are significant limitations to the use of such technologies. This study presents a nonfiducial {PPG}-based subject authentication system. In particular, the photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) signal is first filtered into four signals using the discrete wavelet transform ({DWT}) and then segmented into frames. Ten simple statistical features are extracted from the frame of each signal band to compose the feature vector. Augmenting the feature vector with the same features extracted from the 1st derivative of the corresponding signal is investigated, along with different fusion approaches. A support vector machine ({SVM}) classifier is then employed for the purpose of identity authentication. The proposed authentication system achieved an average authentication accuracy of 99.3\% using a 15 sec frame length with the augmented multiband approach.},

Existing {CA} systems require either the dedicated sensing hardware or specific gestures, whereas our system does not require any users' interactions but only the wearable device, which has already been pervasively equipped with {PPG} sensors. Notably, we design a robust motion artifacts ({MA}) removal method to mitigate the impact of {MA} from wrist movements. Additionally, we explore the characteristic fiducial features from {PPG} measurements to efficiently distinguish the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree ({GBT}). Experiments with the prototype of the wrist-worn {PPG} sensing platform and 10 participants in different scenarios demonstrate that our system can effectively remove {MA} and achieve a high average authentication success rate over \$90\%\$.},

Biometrics have been adopted in security systems to identify persons based on some physiological or behavioral characteristics that they own. Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) is a physiological signal that is used to describe the volumetric change of blood flow in peripherals with heartbeats. The {PPG} signals gained some interest of researchers in the last few years, because they are used non-invasively, and they are easily captured by the emerging {IoT} sensors from fingertips. This paper presents a {PPG}-based approach to identify persons using a neural network classifier. Firstly, {PPG} signals are captured from a number of persons using {IoT} sensors. Then, unique features are extracted from captured {PPG} signals by estimating the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients ({MFCCs}). These features are fed into an Artificial Neural Network ({ANN}) to be trained first and used for identification of persons. A dataset of {PPG} signals for 35 healthy persons was collected to test the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate 100\% and 98.07\% accuracy levels using the hold-out method and the 10-fold cross-validation method, respectively.},

	abstract = {Amongst all medical biometric traits, Photoplethysmograph ({PPG}) is the easiest to acquire. {PPG} records the blood volume change with just combination of Light Emitting Diode and Photodiode from any part of the body. With {IoT} and smart homes' penetration, {PPG} recording can easily be integrated with other vital wearable devices. {PPG} represents peculiarity of hemodynamics and cardiovascular system for each individual. This paper presents nonfiducial method for {PPG} based biometric authentication. Being a physiological signal, {PPG} signal alters with physical/mental stress and time. For robustness, these variations cannot be ignored. While, most of the previous works focused only on single session, this paper demonstrates extensive performance evaluation of {PPG} biometrics against single session data, different emotions, physical exercise and time-lapse using Continuous Wavelet Transform ({CWT}) and Direct Linear Discriminant Analysis ({DLDA}). When evaluated on different states and datasets, equal error rate ({EER}) of 0.5\%-6\% was achieved for 45-60s average training time. Our {CWT}/{DLDA} based technique outperformed all other dimensionality reduction techniques and previous works.},

The study was carried out in a calorimeter room during 24–36 h monitoring on twenty-five, healthy, elderly participants. The results of this study (accuracy of ≈90\%) provide evidence for the feasibility of a non-invasive, {ECG}-based hypoglycemia alarming system. Moreover, leveraging an unsupervised method (i.e. convolutional denoising autoencoder) and visualizing the {ECG} heartbeats in the embeddings space, clear heartbeats clusters grouped by glucose levels could be determined, showing that specific patterns in the input heartbeats are indeed glucose discriminative and the autoencoder could successfully capture those patterns.},

There are two types of Arabic diacritics: The first are core-word diacritics ({CW}), which specify the lexical selection, and the second are case endings ({CE}), which typically appear at the end of word stems and generally specify their syntactic roles. Recovering {CEs} is relatively harder than recovering core-word diacritics due to inter-word dependencies, which are often distant. In this article, we use feature-rich recurrent neural network model that use a variety of linguistic and surface-level features to recover both core word diacritics and case endings. Our model surpasses all previous state-of-the-art systems with a {CW} error rate ({CWER}) of 2.9\% and a {CE} error rate ({CEER}) of 3.7\% for Modern Standard Arabic ({MSA}) and {CWER} of 2.2\% and {CEER} of 2.5\% for Classical Arabic ({CA}). When combining diacritized word cores with case endings, the resultant word error rates are 6.0\% and 4.3\% for {MSA} and {CA}, respectively.

	abstract = {The electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is a widely used, noninvasive test for analyzing arrhythmia. However, the {ECG} signal is prone to contamination by different kinds of noise. Such noise may cause deformation on the {ECG} heartbeat waveform, leading to cardiologists\&rsquo; mislabeling or misinterpreting heartbeats due to varying types of artifacts and interference. To address this problem, some previous studies propose a computerized technique based on machine learning ({ML}) to distinguish between normal and abnormal heartbeats. Unfortunately, {ML} works on a handcrafted, feature-based approach and lacks feature representation. To overcome such drawbacks, deep learning ({DL}) is proposed in the pre-training and fine-tuning phases to produce an automated feature representation for multi-class classification of arrhythmia conditions. In the pre-training phase, stacked denoising autoencoders ({DAEs}) and autoencoders ({AEs}) are used for feature learning; in the fine-tuning phase, deep neural networks ({DNNs}) are implemented as a classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to implement stacked autoencoders by using {DAEs} and {AEs} for feature learning in {DL}. Physionet\&rsquo;s well-known {MIT}-{BIH} Arrhythmia Database, as well as the {MIT}-{BIH} Noise Stress Test Database ({NSTDB}). Only four records are used from the {NSTDB} dataset: 118 24 {dB}, 118 \&minus;6 {dB}, 119 24 {dB}, and 119 \&minus;6 {dB}, with two levels of signal-to-noise ratio ({SNRs}) at 24 {dB} and \&minus;6 {dB}. In the validation process, six models are compared to select the best {DL} model. For all fine-tuned hyperparameters, the best model of {ECG} heartbeat classification achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score of 99.34\%, 93.83\%, 99.57\%, 89.81\%, and 91.44\%, respectively. As the results demonstrate, the proposed {DL} model can extract high-level features not only from the training data but also from unseen data. Such a model has good application prospects in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a critical step towards building a secure and trustworthy system. The primary purpose of a system log is to record system states and significant events at various critical points to help debug system failures and perform root cause analysis. Such log data is universally available in nearly all computer systems. Log data is an important and valuable resource for understanding system status and performance issues; therefore, the various system logs are naturally excellent source of information for online monitoring and anomaly detection. We propose {DeepLog}, a deep neural network model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}), to model a system log as a natural language sequence. This allows {DeepLog} to automatically learn log patterns from normal execution, and detect anomalies when log patterns deviate from the model trained from log data under normal execution. In addition, we demonstrate how to incrementally update the {DeepLog} model in an online fashion so that it can adapt to new log patterns over time. Furthermore, {DeepLog} constructs workflows from the underlying system log so that once an anomaly is detected, users can diagnose the detected anomaly and perform root cause analysis effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations over large log data have shown that {DeepLog} has outperformed other existing log-based anomaly detection methods based on traditional data mining methodologies.},

	abstract = {We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classiﬁcation problems to yield signiﬁcantly lower classiﬁcation error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks ({DBN}), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent {SVM} classiﬁers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},

The analog frontend of the system is designed with a single {NIR} {LED} to record the Photoplethysmographic ({PPG}) signal from the fingertip with motion artifacts removal and a bias current rejection up to 20uA. The proposed digital backend extracts 10 discriminating features from the {PPG} signal to predict the blood glucose level using (Exponential Gaussian Process) machine learning regression. To realize the feature extraction on {FPGA}, a novel two-dimensional structure of 256-point Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) is implemented which achieves a 47\% reduction in complex multiplications compared to the conventional Radix-2 algorithm. The performance of the proposed system is validated using 200 patients {PPG} recordings and glucose levels measured via a commercial glucometer.

Currently, blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer\&mdash;however, this process is uncomfortable for the patient. In this paper, a smartphone video-based noninvasive technique is proposed for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood. The videos are collected steadily from the tip of the subject\&rsquo;s finger using smartphone cameras and subsequently converted into a Photoplethysmography ({PPG}) signal. A Gaussian filter is applied on top of the Asymmetric Least Square ({ALS}) method to remove high-frequency noise, optical noise, and motion interference from the raw {PPG} signal. These preprocessed signals are then used for extracting signal features such as systolic and diastolic peaks, the time differences between consecutive peaks ({DelT}), first derivative, and second derivative peaks. Finally, the features are fed into Principal Component Regression ({PCR}), Partial Least Square Regression ({PLS}), Support Vector Regression ({SVR}) and Random Forest Regression ({RFR}) models for the prediction of glucose level. Out of the four statistical learning techniques used, the {PLS} model, when applied to an unbiased dataset, has the lowest standard error of prediction ({SEP}) at 17.02 mg/{dL}.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a system which estimates blood glucose level ({BGL}) by non-invasive method using Photoplethysmography ({PPG}). Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the {PPG} signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a {PPG} signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of {BGL} values. A {PPG} data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. {BGL} value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and {BGL} value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of {BGL} value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R2 = 0.81. Further, {BGL} estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis ({SPA}) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for {BGL} estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6\% in class A and 17.4\% in class B. 1\% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique ({SPA}) the distribution of data samples are 83\% in class A and 17\% in class B. The proposed features in {SPA} have shown significant improvement in R2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. {SPA} technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer.},

	abstract = {Non-enzymatic glucose sensors outperform enzymatic ones in terms of cost, sensitivity, stability, and operating duration. Though highly sensitive, it is still desirable to further improve the sensitivity of non-enzymatic glucose sensors to detect a trace amount of glucose in sweat and other biofluids. Among the demonstrated effective approaches using bimetals or 3D porous structures, the porous laser-induced graphene ({LIG}) on flexible polymers showcases good conductivity and a simple fabrication process for the integration of sensing materials. The uniform electroless plating of the nickel and gold layer on {LIG} electrodes demonstrates significantly enhanced sensitivity and a large linear range for glucose sensing. The sensor with the porous {LIG} foam exhibits a high sensitivity of 1080 μA {mM}−1 cm−2, whereas a further increased sensitivity of 3500 μA {mM}−1 cm−2 is obtained with {LIG} fibers ({LIGF}). Impressively, a large linear range (0–30 {mM}) can be achieved by changing the bias voltage from 0.5 to 0.1 V due to the Au coating. Because the existing non-enzymatic glucose sensors are limited to use in basic solutions, their application in wearable electronics is elusive. In addition to the reduced requirement for the basic solution, this work integrates a porous encapsulating reaction cavity containing alkali solutions with a soft, skin-interfaced microfluidic component to provide integrated microfluidic non-enzymatic glucose sensors for sweat sampling and glucose sensing. The accurate glucose measurements from the human sweat and cell culture media showcase the practical utility, which opens up opportunities for the non-enzymatic glucose sensors in wearable electronics.},

	abstract = {Objective. Fetal heart rate ({HR}) monitoring is routinely used during pregnancy and labor to assess fetal well-being. The noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram ({ECG}), obtained by electrodes on the maternal abdomen, is a promising alternative to standard fetal monitoring. Subtraction of the maternal {ECG} from the abdominal measurements results in fetal {ECG} signals, in which the fetal {HR} can be determined typically through R-peak detection. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and the nonstationary nature of the fetal {ECG} make R-peak detection a challenging task. Approach. We propose an alternative approach that instead of performing R-peak detection employs deep learning to directly determine the fetal {HR} from the extracted fetal {ECG} signals. We introduce a combination of dilated inception convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) with long short-term memory networks to capture both short-term and long-term temporal dynamics of the fetal {HR}. The robustness of the method is reinforced by a separate {CNN}-based classifier that estimates the reliability of the outcome. Main results. Our method achieved a positive percent agreement (within 10\% of the actual fetal {HR} value) of 97.3\% on a dataset recorded during labor and 99.6\% on set-A of the 2013 Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge exceeding top-performing state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. Significance. The proposed method can potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of fetal {HR} extraction in clinical practice.},

The automatic detection of {ECG} signals becomes increasingly necessary. This paper proposes an automatic classification of {ECG} signals based on a dilated causal convolutional neural network. To solve the problem that the recurrent neural network framework network cannot be accelerated by hardware equipment, the dilated causal convolutional neural network is adopted. Given the features of the same input and output time steps of the recurrent neural network and the nondisclosure of future information, the network is constructed with fully convolutional networks and causal convolution. To reduce the network depth and prevent gradient explosion or gradient disappearance, the dilated factor is introduced into the model, and the residual blocks are introduced into the model according to the shortcut connection idea. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified in the {MIT}-{BIH} Atrial Fibrillation Database ({MIT}-{BIH} {AFDB}). In the experiment of the {MIT}-{BIH} {AFDB} database, the classification accuracy rate is 98.65\%.},

Because of that, an accurate continuing hypoglycemia monitoring system is a very important medical device for diabetic patients. In this paper, we proposed a non-invasive hypoglycemia monitoring system using the physiological parameters of electrocardiography ({ECG}) signal. To enhance the detection accuracy, extreme learning machine ({ELM}) is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemia.

	abstract = {Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that results in abnormal blood glucose ({BG}) regulations. The {BG} level is preferably maintained close to normality through self-management practices, which involves actively tracking {BG} levels and taking proper actions including adjusting diet and insulin medications. {BG} anomalies could be defined as any undesirable reading because of either a precisely known reason (normal cause variation) or an unknown reason (special cause variation) to the patient. Recently, machine-learning applications have been widely introduced within diabetes research in general and {BG} anomaly detection in particular. However, irrespective of their expanding and increasing popularity, there is a lack of up-to-date reviews that materialize the current trends in modeling options and strategies for {BG} anomaly classification and detection in people with diabetes. Objective: This review aimed to identify, assess, and analyze the state-of-the-art machine-learning strategies and their hybrid systems focusing on {BG} anomaly classification and detection including glycemic variability ({GV}), hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes within the context of personalized decision support systems and {BG} alarm events applications, which are important constituents for optimal diabetes self-management. Methods: A rigorous literature search was conducted between September 1 and October 1, 2017, and October 15 and November 5, 2018, through various Web-based databases. Peer-reviewed journals and articles were considered. Information from the selected literature was extracted based on predefined categories, which were based on previous research and further elaborated through brainstorming. Results: The initial results were vetted using the title, abstract, and keywords and retrieved 496 papers. After a thorough assessment and screening, 47 articles remained, which were critically analyzed. The interrater agreement was measured using a Cohen kappa test, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. The state-of-the-art classes of machine learning have been developed and tested up to the task and achieved promising performance including artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, genetic algorithm, Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, deep belief network, and others. Conclusions: Despite the complexity of {BG} dynamics, there are many attempts to capture hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia incidences and the extent of an individual’s {GV} using different approaches. Recently, the advancement of diabetes technologies and continuous accumulation of self-collected health data have paved the way for popularity of machine learning in these tasks. According to the review, most of the identified studies used a theoretical threshold, which suffers from inter- and intrapatient variation. Therefore, future studies should consider the difference among patients and also track its temporal change over time. Moreover, studies should also give more emphasis on the types of inputs used and their associated time lag. Generally, we foresee that these developments might encourage researchers to further develop and test these systems on a large-scale basis.},

	abstract = {Continuous glucose monitoring is important in the management of diabetes. According to statistics, diabetes is the third chronic non-infectious disease that seriously endangers people's health, followed by tumor as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In 2019, globally, there were a total of 460 million diabetics aged 20–79 years, which accounted for 9.1\% of the total population in this cohort. Each figure is projected to increase to 592 million and by 10.1\% respectively by 2035. Currently, the methods of blood glucose monitoring can be divided into invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive. The main methods for blood glucose monitoring include irregular sampling of fingertip blood or consecutive measurement of interstitial fluid glucose based on implantable sensors. However, these methods have some limitations, which include pain sensation, high cost, short service life, and susceptibility. Patients need to measure their blood glucose frequently. Invasive and minimally invasive monitoring will cause physical and psychological pain. Therefore, noninvasive monitoring is one of the most promising techniques for continuous monitoring of blood glucose, and it has a broad market prospect. In this study, the electrocardiogram ({ECG} signals) were used to achieve the noninvasive monitoring of blood glucose levels. First, 756160 {ECG} periodic signals of 12 volunteers for 60 d were obtained from the experiment. Second, the {ECG} signals were preprocessed using an infinite impulse response filter. Furthermore, a method combining convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks ({CNN}-{LSTM}) was proposed for blood glucose monitoring. In Addition, two modeling methods (individual modeling and group modeling) were investigated in this study. The results show that the precision of blood glucose monitoring under the condition of individual and group modeling is 80\% and 88\%, respectively. The F1-score of the group modeling can reach 0.95, 0.88, 0.91, 0.85, 0.92, 0.88, 0.86, 0.86, 0.87, and 0.86. Therefore, this study indicates that the proposed method based on {ECG} signals can provide powerful theoretical support and technical guidance for real-time and accurate blood glucose monitoring.},

Electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is one of the physiological signals used in the cardiovascular and medical fields that has encouraged researchers to discover new non-invasive methods to diagnose hyperglycemia as a personal variable. Over the years, researchers have proposed different techniques to detect hyperglycemia using {ECG}. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that can identify hyperglycemia using heartbeats from {ECG} signals. In addition, we introduce a new fiducial feature extraction technique that improves the performance of the deep learning classifier. We evaluate the proposed method with {ECG} data from 1119 different subjects to assess the efficiency of hyperglycemia detection of the proposed work. The result indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in detecting hyperglycemia with a 94.53\% area under the curve ({AUC}), 87.57\% sensitivity, and 85.04\% specificity. That performance represents an relative improvement of 53\% versus the best model found in the literature. The high sensitivity and specificity achieved by the 10-layer deep neural network proposed in this work provide an excellent indication that {ECG} possesses intrinsic information that can indicate the level of blood glucose concentration.},

	abstract = {Human behavior gained much attention as a means of identifying a subject from the dynamics of some of its signals. This produced challenging questions, opening a broad area of signals to explore and new methodologies to propose in answering a difficult problem: How to extract, combine and classify characteristics from dynamic sources to distinguish a large number of classes. This thesis addresses this broad issue of behavioral biometrics, introducing new signal sources, novel signal models and advanced classification strategies in a multidisciplinary approach.
Signals of Human-Computer Interaction from the mouse movement were collected using a new remote interaction acquisition system developed in the context of the present thesis. The Electrocardiography and Electrodermal Activity signals were also collected and their relation to the subject identity has been studied. Original contributions, in terms of novel signals and processing models, form the basis of the processing and feature extraction tools. The data modeling and classification of these signals is a hard task that arises from the difficulty in data separation. Original theoretical and algorithmic contributions addressing this issue are proposed in the thesis, namely usertuned feature selection, sequential classification, and fusion under uncertainty. These approaches, with a set of computational improvements, show the potential of these new behavioral biometrics traits, both in single and multimodal biometrics scenarios.},

It provides a comprehensive suite of processing routines for a variety of bodily signals (e.g., {ECG}, {PPG}, {EDA}, {EMG}, {RSP}). These processing routines include high-level functions that enable data processing in a few lines of code using validated pipelines, which we illustrate in two examples covering the most typical scenarios, such as an event-related paradigm and an interval-related analysis. The package also includes tools for specific processing steps such as rate extraction and filtering methods, offering a trade-off between high-level convenience and fine-tuned control. Its goal is to improve transparency and reproducibility in neurophysiological research, as well as foster exploration and innovation. Its design philosophy is centred on user-experience and accessibility to both novice and advanced users.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) monitoring is not only essential for critically ill patients in hospitals or at home, but also for those undergoing exercise testing. However, processing {PPG} signals measured after exercise is challenging, especially if the environment is hot and humid. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that can detect systolic peaks under challenging conditions, as in the case of emergency responders in tropical conditions. Accurate systolic-peak detection is an important first step for the analysis of heart rate variability. Algorithms based on local maxima-minima, first-derivative, and slope sum are evaluated, and a new algorithm is introduced to improve the detection rate. With 40 healthy subjects, the new algorithm demonstrates the highest overall detection accuracy (99.84\% sensitivity, 99.89\% positive predictivity). Existing algorithms, such as Billauer's, Li's and Zong's, have comparable although lower accuracy. However, the proposed algorithm presents an advantage for real-time applications by avoiding human intervention in threshold determination. For best performance, we show that a combination of two event-related moving averages with an offset threshold has an advantage in detecting systolic peaks, even in heat-stressed {PPG} signals.},

	abstract = {For both the acquisition of mobile electrocardiogram ({ECG}) devices and early warning and diagnosis of clinical work, high-quality {ECG} signals is particularly important. We describe an effective system which could be deployed as a stand-alone signal quality assessment algorithm for vetting the quality of {ECG} signals. The proposed {ECG} quality assessment method is based on the simple heuristic fusion and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the {SQIs}. This method includes two modules, i.e., the quantification and extraction of Signal Quality Indexes ({SQIs}) for different features, intelligent assessment and classification. First, simple heuristic fusion is executed to extract {SQIs} and determine the following {SQIs}: R peak detection match {qSQI}, {QRS} wave power spectrum distribution {pSQI}, kurtosis {kSQI}, and baseline relative power {basSQI}. Then, combined with Cauchy distribution, rectangular distribution and trapezoidal distribution, the membership function of {SQIs} was quantified, and the fuzzy vector was established. The bounded operator was selected for fuzzy synthesis, and the weighted membership function was used to perform the assessment and classification. The performance of the proposed method was tested on the database from Physionet {ECG} database, with an accuracy (Acc) of 97.67\%, sensitivity (Se) of 96.33\% and specificity (Sp) of 98.33\% on the training set. Testing against the test datasets resulted in scores of 94.67, 90.33, and 93.00\%, respectively. There's no gold standard exists for determining the quality of {ECGs}. However, the proposed algorithm discriminates between high- and poor-quality {ECGs}, which could aid in {ECG} acquisition for mobile {ECG} devices, early clinical diagnosis and early warning.},

	abstract = {For imbalanced datasets, the focus of classification is to identify samples of the minority class. The performance of current data mining algorithms is not good enough for processing imbalanced datasets. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique ({SMOTE}) is specifically designed for learning from imbalanced datasets, generating synthetic minority class examples by interpolating between minority class examples nearby. However, the {SMOTE} encounters the overgeneralization problem. The densitybased spatial clustering of applications with noise ({DBSCAN}) is not rigorous when dealing with the samples near the borderline. We optimize the {DBSCAN} algorithm for this problem to make clustering more reasonable. This paper integrates the optimized {DBSCAN} and {SMOTE}, and proposes a density-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique ({DSMOTE}). First, the optimized {DBSCAN} is used to divide the samples of the minority class into three groups, including core samples, borderline samples and noise samples, and then the noise samples of minority class is removed to synthesize more effective samples. In order to make full use of the information of core samples and borderline samples, different strategies are used to over-sample core samples and borderline samples. Experiments show that {DSMOTE} can achieve better results compared with {SMOTE} and Borderline-{SMOTE} in terms of precision, recall and F-value.},

	abstract = {Predictive performance of Machine Learning ({ML}) models rely on the quality of data used for training the models. However, if the training data is not balanced among different classes, the performance of {ML} models deteriorate heavily. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to add some semblance of balance to the data sets by adding artificial data points. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique({SMOTE}) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling({ADASYN}) are some of the commonly used techniques to deal with class imbalance. However, these approaches are prone to ‘within class imbalance’ and ‘small disjunct problem’. To overcome these problems, this article proposes an advanced algorithm by studying the compactness and location of the minority class relative to other classes. The proposed technique called K-Nearest Neighbor {OveRsampling} approach ({KNNOR}) performs a three step process to identify the critical and safe areas for augmentation and generate synthetic data points of the minority class. The relative density of the entire population is considered while generating artificial points. This enables the proposed {KNNOR} approach to oversample the minority class more reliably and at the same time stay resilient against noise. The proposed method is compared with the ten top performing contemporary oversamplers by testing the accuracy of classifiers trained on augmented data provided by each oversampler. The experimental results on several common imbalanced datasets show that our method ranks first more consistently than the other state-of-art oversamplers. The proposed method is easy to use and has been made open source as a python library.},

Through exhaustive analysis, we strive to streamline and standardize experimental decisions by showcasing their impact on the outcome of the study, and generate guidelines for a more objective design of shoulder surfing experiments.},

	abstract = {Predictive performance of Machine Learning ({ML}) models rely on the quality of data used for training the models. However, if the training data is not balanced among different classes, the performance of {ML} models deteriorate heavily. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to add some semblance of balance to the data sets by adding artificial data points. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique({SMOTE}) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling({ADASYN}) are some of the commonly used techniques to deal with class imbalance. However, these approaches are prone to ‘within class imbalance’ and ‘small disjunct problem’. To overcome these problems, this article proposes an advanced algorithm by studying the compactness and location of the minority class relative to other classes. The proposed technique called K-Nearest Neighbor {OveRsampling} approach ({KNNOR}) performs a three step process to identify the critical and safe areas for augmentation and generate synthetic data points of the minority class. The relative density of the entire population is considered while generating artificial points. This enables the proposed {KNNOR} approach to oversample the minority class more reliably and at the same time stay resilient against noise. The proposed method is compared with the ten top performing contemporary oversamplers by testing the accuracy of classifiers trained on augmented data provided by each oversampler. The experimental results on several common imbalanced datasets show that our method ranks first more consistently than the other state-of-art oversamplers. The proposed method is easy to use and has been made open source as a python library.},

Moreover, {PPG} is a promising technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be helpful for regular {GP}-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the {PPG} waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation.

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor ({LOF}) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that {LOF} enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that {LOF} can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

	abstract = {Outlier detection is a statistical procedure that aims to find suspicious events or items that are different from the normal form of a dataset. It has drawn considerable interest in the field of data mining and machine learning. Outlier detection is important in many applications, including fraud detection in credit card transactions and network intrusion detection. There are two general types of outlier detection: global and local. Global outliers fall outside the normal range for an entire dataset, whereas local outliers may fall within the normal range for the entire dataset, but outside the normal range for the surrounding data points. This paper addresses local outlier detection. The best-known technique for local outlier detection is the Local Outlier Factor ({LOF}), a density-based technique. There are many {LOF} algorithms for a static data environment; however, these algorithms cannot be applied directly to data streams, which are an important type of big data. In general, local outlier detection algorithms for data streams are still deficient and better algorithms need to be developed that can effectively analyze the high velocity of data streams to detect local outliers. This paper presents a literature review of local outlier detection algorithms in static and stream environments, with an emphasis on {LOF} algorithms. It collects and categorizes existing local outlier detection algorithms and analyzes their characteristics. Furthermore, the paper discusses the advantages and limitations of those algorithms and proposes several promising directions for developing improved local outlier detection methods for data streams.},

In this paper, we study the impact of separating the estimation problem. It turns out that simple one-class classification methods can be easily derived, by considering a least-squares formulation. The proposed framework allows us to derive some theoretical results, such as an upper bound on the probability of false detection. The relevance of this work is illustrated on well-known datasets.},

	abstract = {The minimum covariance determinant ({MCD}) method of Rousseeuw (1984) is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Its objective is to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. Until now applications of the {MCD} were hampered by the computation time of existing algorithms, which were limited to a few hundred objects in a few dimensions. We discuss two important applications of larger size: one about a production process at Philips with n = 677 objects and p = 9 variables, and a data set from astronomy with n =137,256 objects and p = 27 variables. To deal with such problems we have developed a new algorithm for the {MCD}, called {FAST}-{MCD}. The basic ideas are an inequality involving order statistics and determinants, and techniques which we call `selective iteration' and `nested extensions'. For small data sets {FAST}-{MCD} typically finds the exact {MCD}, whereas for larger data sets it gives more accurate results than existing algorithms.},

Low blood glucose, also known as hypoglycemia, can be a dangerous and can result in unconsciousness, seizures and even death. In recent studies, heart rate ({HR}) and correct {QT} interval ({QTc}) of the electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signal are found as the most common physiological parameters to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction. In this paper, a state-of-the-art intelligent technology namely deep belief network ({DBN}) is developed as an intelligent diagnostics system to recognize the onset of hypoglycemia. The proposed {DBN} provides a superior classification performance with feature transformation on either processed or un-processed data. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hypoglycemia detection system, 15 children with Type 1 diabetes were volunteered overnight. Comparing with several existing methodologies, the experimental results showed that the proposed {DBN} outperformed and achieved better classification performance.},

Continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is today possible thanks to consumer-grade wearable devices, enabling transformative diagnostic and patient management tools. Such monitoring is possible using low-cost easy-to-implement optical sensors that today equip the majority of wearables. These sensors record blood volume variations—a technology known as photoplethysmography ({PPG})—from which the heart rate and other physiological parameters can be extracted to inform about user activity, fitness, sleep, and health. Recently, new wearable devices were introduced as being capable of {AF} detection, evidenced by large prospective trials in some cases. Such devices would allow for early screening of {AF} and initiation of therapy to prevent stroke. This review is a summary of a body of work on {AF} detection using {PPG}. A thorough account of the signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning approaches used in these studies is presented, followed by a discussion of their limitations and challenges towards clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Upper limb amputation is a condition that significantly restricts the amputees from performing their daily activities. The myoelectric prosthesis, using signals from residual stump muscles, is aimed at restoring the function of such lost limbs seamlessly. Unfortunately, the acquisition and use of such myosignals are cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, once acquired, it usually requires heavy computational power to turn it into a user control signal. Its transition to a practical prosthesis solution is still being challenged by various factors particularly those related to the fact that each amputee has different mobility, muscle contraction forces, limb positional variations and electrode placements. Thus, a solution that can adapt or otherwise tailor itself to each individual is required for maximum utility across amputees. Modified machine learning schemes for pattern recognition have the potential to significantly reduce the factors (movement of users and contraction of the muscle) affecting the traditional electromyography ({EMG})-pattern recognition methods. Although recent developments of intelligent pattern recognition techniques could discriminate multiple degrees of freedom with high-level accuracy, their efficiency level was less accessible and revealed in real-world (amputee) applications. This review paper examined the suitability of upper limb prosthesis ({ULP}) inventions in the healthcare sector from their technical control perspective. More focus was given to the review of real-world applications and the use of pattern recognition control on amputees. We first reviewed the overall structure of pattern recognition schemes for myo-control prosthetic systems and then discussed their real-time use on amputee upper limbs. Finally, we concluded the paper with a discussion of the existing challenges and future research recommendations.},

However, the control robustness offered by scientific research is still not sufficient for many real life applications, and commercial prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few movements. In recent years deep learning revolutionized several fields of machine learning, including computer vision and speech recognition. Our objective is to test its methods for natural control of robotic hands via {sEMG} using a large number of intact subjects and amputees. We tested convolutional networks for the classification of an average of 50 hand movements in 67 intact subjects and 11 transradial amputees. The simple architecture of the neural network allowed to make several tests in order to evaluate the effect of pre-processing, layer architecture, data augmentation and optimization. The classification results are compared with a set of classical classification methods applied on the same datasets. The classification accuracy obtained with convolutional neural networks using the proposed architecture is higher than the average results obtained with the classical classification methods, but lower than the results obtained with the best reference methods in our tests. The results show that convolutional neural networks with a very simple architecture can produce accurate results comparable to the average classical classification methods. They show that several factors (including pre-processing, the architecture of the net and the optimization parameters) can be fundamental for the analysis of {sEMG} data. Larger networks can achieve higher accuracy on computer vision and object recognition tasks. This fact suggests that it may be interesting to evaluate if larger networks can increase {sEMG} classification accuracy too.},

	abstract = {Natural muscles provide mobility in response to nerve impulses. Electromyography ({EMG}) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, {EMG} signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret {EMG} signals. However, the performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw {EMG} signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our approach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with {TensorFlow} deep learning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics processing units of {NVIDIA} Jetson {TX}2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate the ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw {EMG} signals. We anticipate our {EMG}-based control system to be a starting point to design more sophisticated prosthetic hands. For example, a pressure measurement unit can be added to transfer the perception of the environment to the user. Furthermore, our system can be modified for other prosthetic devices.},

In this paper, we analyze recent papers and present a literature review describing the role that deep learning plays in {EMG}-based {HMI}. An overview of typical network structures and processing schemes will be provided. Recent progress in typical tasks such as movement classification, joint angle prediction, and force/torque estimation will be introduced.

We attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of current research by discussing the advantages, challenges, and opportunities brought by deep learning.

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning algorithms have become increasingly more prominent for their unparalleled ability to automatically learn discriminant features from large amounts of data. However, within the field of electromyography-based gesture recognition, deep learning algorithms are seldom employed as they require an unreasonable amount of effort from a single person, to generate tens of thousands of examples. This paper's hypothesis is that general, informative features can be learned from the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple users, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition. Consequently, this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data from multiple users while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms to learn discriminant features from large datasets. Two datasets comprised 19 and 17 able-bodied participants, respectively (the first one is employed for pre-training), were recorded for this work, using the Myo armband. A third Myo armband dataset was taken from the {NinaPro} database and is comprised ten able-bodied participants. Three different deep learning networks employing three different modalities as input (raw {EMG}, spectrograms, and continuous wavelet transform ({CWT})) are tested on the second and third dataset. The proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly enhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving an offline accuracy of 98.31\% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the {CWT}-based {ConvNet} and 68.98\% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw {EMG}-based {ConvNet}. Finally, a use-case study employing eight able-bodied participants suggests that real-time feedback allows users to adapt their muscle activation strategy which reduces the degradation in accuracy normally experienced over time.},

	abstract = {A bionic hand with fine motor ability could be a favorable option for replacing the human hand when performing various operations. Myoelectric control has been widely used to recognize hand movements in recent years. However, most of the previous studies have focused on whole-hand movements, with only a few investigating subtler motions. The aim of this study was to construct a prototype system for recognizing hand postures with the aim of controlling a bionic hand by analyzing {sEMG} signals measured at the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles. We adopted multiple features commonly used in previous studies—mean absolute value, zero crossing, slope sign change, and waveform length—in the algorithm for extracting hand-posture features, and the k-nearest-neighbors ({KNN}) algorithm as the classifier to perform hand-posture recognition. The bionic hand was controlled by an Arduino microprocessor, which converted the signals received from the classification process that were fed to the servo motors controlling the bionic fingers. We constructed a two-channel {sEMG} pattern-recognition system that can identify human hand postures and control a homemade bionic hand to perform corresponding hand postures. The {KNN} approach was able to recognize four different hand postures with a classification accuracy of 94\% in the online experiment by using the channel combination. Moreover, the experimental tests show that the bionic hand could faithfully imitate the hand postures of the human hand. This study has bridged the gap between the features of {sEMG} signals of fingers and the postures of a bionic hand.},

In this work, we employ an unsupervised method for recognizing physical activities using smartphone accelerometers. Features are extracted from the raw acceleration data collected by smartphones, then an unsupervised classification method called {MCODE} is used for activity recognition. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on three real-world datasets, i.e., a public dataset of daily living activities and two datasets of sports activities of race walking and basketball playing collected by ourselves, and we find our method outperforms other existing methods. The results show that our method is viable to recognize physical activities using smartphone accelerometers.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({ConvNets}) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up {MobileNets} and {ResNet}. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called {EfficientNets}, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous {ConvNets}. In particular, our {EfficientNet}-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing {ConvNet}. Our {EfficientNets} also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on {CIFAR}-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

The Alertgy noninvasive continuous glucose monitor ({ANICGM}) is a novel wristband device that reports glucose levels without entailing skin puncture. This study evaluated the performance of the {ANICGM} compared to a Food and Drug Administration-approved glucose meter in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
The {ANICGM} device measures changes in the electromagnetic field generated by its sensor to produce a dielectric spectrum. The data contained within this spectrum are used in tandem with machine learning algorithms to estimate blood glucose levels. Values from the {ANICGM} were collected, sent to the Alertgy lab, formatted, and compared with fingerstick blood glucose levels, which were measured using the Accuchek Inform {II} glucometer. Fifteen patients completed three 120-minute sessions. The mean absolute relative difference ({MARD}) was calculated.
Results
{MARD} values were compared between study days 2 and 3. The {MARD} for day 2 was 18.5\% (95\% {CI}, 12.8-42.2\%), and the {MARD} for day 3 was 15.3\% (95\% {CI}, 12.3-18.4\%). The difference in the {MARD} between days 2 and 3 was not statistically significant (P = .210).
Conclusion
The resulting {MARDs} suggest that further investigation into the use of dielectric spectroscopy for glucose monitoring should be explored.},

These methods lack reliability when the explanation is sensitive to factors that do not contribute to the model prediction. We use a simple and common pre-processing step which can be compensated for easily—adding a constant shift to the input data—to show that a transformation with no effect on how the model makes the decision can cause numerous methods to attribute incorrectly. In order to guarantee reliability, we believe that the explanation should not change when we can guarantee that two networks process the images in identical manners. We show, through several examples, that saliency methods that do not satisfy this requirement result in misleading attribution. The approach can be seen as a type of unit test; we construct a narrow ground truth to measure one stated desirable property. As such, we hope the community will embrace the development of additional tests.},

These test sare compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for the difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, {McNemar}'s test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 × 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5×2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than {McNemar}'s test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, Mc-Nemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 × 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

The output weights of these neural networks are computed using pseudoinverse. At the output layer, multilabel classification is performed by using an adaptive threshold function. The computation of output weights using pseudoinverse retains the faster computation power of these algorithms compared to iterative learning algorithms. The adaptive threshold function used in the proposed approach can consider the correlation among the output labels and the whole dataset for threshold computation. Five multilabel evaluation metrics evaluate the proposed multilabel neural networks on 12 benchmark datasets of various domains such as text, image, and genomics. The {ML}-{KRVFL} provides the overall best Friedman rankings on five evaluation metrics followed by {ML}-{RVFL}, {ML}-{FBLS}, and {ML}-{BLS}, respectively.

	abstract = {In this paper, we first introduce batch normalization to the {edRVFL} network. This re-normalization method can help the network avoid divergence of the hidden features. Then we propose novel variants of Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link ({edRVFL}). Weighted {edRVFL} ({WedRVFL}) uses weighting methods to give training samples different weights in different layers according to how the samples were classified confidently in the previous layer thereby increasing the ensemble's diversity and accuracy. Furthermore, a pruning-based {edRVFL} ({PedRVFL}) has also been proposed. We prune some inferior neurons based on their importance for classification before generating the next hidden layer. Through this method, we ensure that the randomly generated inferior features will not propagate to deeper layers. Subsequently, the combination of weighting and pruning, called Weighting and Pruning based Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link Network ({WPedRVFL}), is proposed. We compare their performances with other state-of-the-art deep feedforward neural networks ({FNNs}) on 24 tabular {UCI} classification datasets.

	abstract = {Integration of renewable resources and increased growth in energy consumption has created new challenges for the traditional electrical network. To adhere to these challenges, Internet of Everything ({IoE}) has transformed the existing power grid into a modernized electrical network called Smart Grid. An integral part of this transformation is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure ({AMI}), which enables two-way communication for flow of information consisting of energy consumption, outages, and electricity rates between smart meters and the utilities. These enhanced {AMI} features and privileges have resulted in a larger surface for cyber-attack, enabling remote exploitation of these smart devices without any physical access. Therefore, consumer privacy and security has become a critical issue due to the interconnection of different smart devices in various communication networks and the information they carry. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of privacy related research in the {IoE} enabled smart grid environment. The survey presents a detailed analysis of privacy problems and their corresponding solutions in {AMI}. Our goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the smart grid and shed light on future research directions.},

Due to cybersecurity attacks and threats, data aggregation operations in a smart grid are challenging. The majority of existing techniques have high computation and communication costs and are still vulnerable to various security and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a deep learning and homomorphic encryption-based privacy-preserving data aggregation model to mitigate the negative impact of a flash workload on the accuracy of prediction models. The model also ensures a secure data aggregation process with low computational overhead. The proposed model is 80\% more effective than the traditional approach in detecting smart meter manipulation, and the computation cost is 20\% to 80\% less than existing techniques. Thus, the proposed blockchain and homomorphic encryption-based data aggregation ({BHDA}) scheme shows a significant improvement in performance and privacy preservation with minimal computation overhead for data aggregation in smart grids.},

	abstract = {In smart grids, a major challenge is how to effectively utilize consumers’ energy consumption data while preserving security and privacy. In this article, we tackle this challenging issue and focus on energy theft detection, which is very important for smart grids. Specifically, we note that most existing energy theft detection schemes are centralized, which may be unscalable, and more importantly, may be very difficult to protect data privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection, namely, {FedDetect}. In our framework, we consider a federated learning system that consists of a data center ({DC}), a control center ({CC}), and multiple detection stations. In this system, each detection station ({DTS}) can only observe data from local consumers, which can use a local differential privacy ({LDP}) scheme to process their data to preserve privacy. To facilitate the training of the model, we design a secure protocol so that detection stations can send encrypted training parameters to the {CC} and the {DC}, which then use homomorphic encryption to calculate the aggregated parameters and return updated model parameters to detection stations. In our study, we prove the security of the proposed protocol with solid security analysis. To detect energy theft, we design a deep learning model based on the state-of-the-art temporal convolutional network ({TCN}). Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead.},

It incorporates a novel reliable peer-to-peer energy system that is based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm and it achieves high throughput. In order to prevent smart grid attacks, the proposed framework makes the generation of blocks using short signatures and hash functions. The proposed deep learning-based scheme is an intrusion detection system ({IDS}), which employs recurrent neural networks for detecting network attacks and fraudulent transactions in the blockchain-based energy network.

	shorttitle = {Sphinx},
	abstract = {With the growing complexity of deep learning applications, users have started to delegate their data and models to the cloud. Among these applications, online learning services, which involve both training and inference procedures, are widely deployed. To ensure privacy guarantee on the public cloud, researchers have proposed a plethora of privacy-preserving deep learning algorithms with different techniques, ranging from obfuscation mechanisms to cryptographic tools. However, none of them is applicable to online learning services. They either focus only on inference or training procedure while ignoring the other, or require non-colluding or trusted third parties. In this paper, we present Sphinx, an efficient and privacy-preserving online deep learning system without any trusted third parties. Sphinx strikes a balance between model performance, computational efficiency, and privacy preservation with systematical optimizations on both private inference and training protocols. At its core, Sphinx synthesizes homomorphic encryption and differential privacy reciprocally to maintain the model by keeping most of its parameters as plaintexts, enabling fast training and inference protocol designs. Meanwhile, by refining the homomorphic operation behaviors, Sphinx avoids most of the heavyweight homomorphic operations and minimizes the communication cost. As a result, Sphinx is able to reduce the training time significantly while achieving real-time inference without exposing user privacy. In our experiments, we find that compared to the pure homomorphic encryption solution, Sphinx is $^{\textrm{-5\$}}$ for {MNIST}) without a trusted data aggregator, and is more robust against practical reconstruction attacks.},

	abstract = {Once users have shared their data online, it is generally difficult for them to revoke access and ask for the data to be deleted. Machine learning ({ML}) exacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have memorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing their information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult.We introduce {SISA} training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure. While our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. {SISA} training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set. In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead from unlearning.Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains, with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that {SISA} training improves time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63×, and 2.45× for the {SVHN} dataset, over retraining from scratch. {SISA} training also provides a speed-up of 1.36× in retraining for complex learning tasks such as {ImageNet} classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation in accuracy. Our work contributes to practical data governance in machine unlearning.},

	shorttitle = {Adversary Instantiation},
	abstract = {Differentially private ({DP}) machine learning allows us to train models on private data while limiting data leakage. {DP} formalizes this data leakage through a cryptographic game, where an adversary must predict if a model was trained on a dataset D, or a dataset D′ that differs in just one example. If observing the training algorithm does not meaningfully increase the adversary's odds of successfully guessing which dataset the model was trained on, then the algorithm is said to be differentially private. Hence, the purpose of privacy analysis is to upper bound the probability that any adversary could successfully guess which dataset the model was trained on.In our paper, we instantiate this hypothetical adversary in order to establish lower bounds on the probability that this distinguishing game can be won. We use this adversary to evaluate the importance of the adversary capabilities allowed in the privacy analysis of {DP} training algorithms.For {DP}-{SGD}, the most common method for training neural networks with differential privacy, our lower bounds are tight and match the theoretical upper bound. This implies that in order to prove better upper bounds, it will be necessary to make use of additional assumptions. Fortunately, we find that our attacks are significantly weaker when additional (realistic) restrictions are put in place on the adversary's capabilities. Thus, in the practical setting common to many real-world deployments, there is a gap between our lower bounds and the upper bounds provided by the analysis: differential privacy is conservative and adversaries may not be able to leak as much information as suggested by the theoretical bound.},

	abstract = {We introduce {CryptGPU}, a system for privacy-preserving machine learning that implements all operations on the {GPU} (graphics processing unit). Just as {GPUs} played a pivotal role in the success of modern deep learning, they are also essential for realizing scalable privacy-preserving deep learning. In this work, we start by introducing a new interface to losslessly embed cryptographic operations over secret-shared values (in a discrete domain) into floating-point operations that can be processed by highly-optimized {CUDA} kernels for linear algebra. We then identify a sequence of "{GPU}-friendly" cryptographic protocols to enable privacy-preserving evaluation of both linear and non-linear operations on the {GPU}. Our microbenchmarks indicate that our private {GPU}-based convolution protocol is over 150× faster than the analogous {CPU}-based protocol; for non-linear operations like the {ReLU} activation function, our {GPU}-based protocol is around 10× faster than its {CPU} analog. With {CryptGPU}, we support private inference and training on convolutional neural networks with over 60 million parameters as well as handle large datasets like {ImageNet}. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our protocols achieve a 2× to 8× improvement in private inference for large networks and datasets. For private training, we achieve a 6× to 36× improvement over prior state-of-the-art. Our work not only showcases the viability of performing secure multiparty computation ({MPC}) entirely on the {GPU} to newly enable fast privacy-preserving machine learning, but also highlights the importance of designing new {MPC} primitives that can take full advantage of the {GPU}’s computing capabilities.},

	abstract = {The newly emerged machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning are still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This article surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning-aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.},

	abstract = {Federated learning ({FL}), as a type of distributed machine learning, is capable of significantly preserving clients' private data from being exposed to adversaries. Nevertheless, private information can still be divulged by analyzing uploaded parameters from clients, e.g., weights trained in deep neural networks. In this paper, to effectively prevent information leakage, we propose a novel framework based on the concept of differential privacy ({DP}), in which artificial noise is added to parameters at the clients' side before aggregating, namely, noising before model aggregation {FL} ({NbAFL}). First, we prove that the {NbAFL} can satisfy {DP} under distinct protection levels by properly adapting different variances of artificial noise. Then we develop a theoretical convergence bound on the loss function of the trained {FL} model in the {NbAFL}. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key properties: 1) there is a tradeoff between convergence performance and privacy protection levels, i.e., better convergence performance leads to a lower protection level; 2) given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing the number N of overall clients participating in {FL} can improve the convergence performance; and 3) there is an optimal number aggregation times (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given protection level. Furthermore, we propose a K-client random scheduling strategy, where K (1 ≤ K {\textless}; N) clients are randomly selected from the N overall clients to participate in each aggregation. We also develop a corresponding convergence bound for the loss function in this case and the K-client random scheduling strategy also retains the above three properties. Moreover, we find that there is an optimal K that achieves the best convergence performance at a fixed privacy level. Evaluations demonstrate that our theoretical results are consistent with simulations, thereby facilitating the design of various privacy-preserving {FL} algorithms with different tradeoff requirements on convergence performance and privacy levels.},

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone–Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line.},

Our work aims to evaluate the suitability of these frameworks from a usability, runtime requirements and accuracy point of view. In order to better understand the gap between state-of-the-art protocols and what is currently available in practice for a data scientist, we designed three neural network architecture to obtain secure predictions via each of the four aforementioned frameworks. Two networks were evaluated on the {MNIST} dataset and one on the Malaria Cell image dataset.

In this paper, we propose an energy theft detection scheme with energy privacy preservation in the smart grid. Especially, we use combined convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to detect abnormal behavior of the metering data from a long-period pattern observation. In addition, we employ Paillier algorithm to protect the energy privacy. In other words, the users’ energy data are securely protected in the transmission and the data disclosure is minimized. Our security analysis demonstrates that in our scheme data privacy and authentication are both achieved. Experimental results illustrate that our modified {CNN} model can effectively detect abnormal behaviors at an accuracy up to 92.67\%.},

Results: {CNBD} was significantly lower in patients with high {GV} compared to low {GV} median (range) (25.0(19.0-37.5) vs. 38.6(29.2-46.9); P=0.007); in patients who spent {\textgreater}4\% compared to {\textless}4\% time below range (54-69 mg/dl) (25.0(22.9-37.5) vs. 37.5(29.2-46.9); P=0.045) and in patients who spent {\textgreater}1\% compared to {\textless}1\% time in severe hypoglycemia ({\textless}54 mg/dl) (25.0 (19.8-41.7) vs. 35.4 (28.1-44.8); P=0.04). Duration in hyperglycemia and severe hyperglycemia did not correlate with {CNFD} (P{\textgreater}0.05), {CNBD} (P{\textgreater}0.05), {CNFL} (P{\textgreater}0.05) or {IWL} (P{\textgreater}0.05), but duration in hypoglycemia correlated with {CNBD} (r=-0.342, P=0.031). Conclusions: Greater glucose variability and duration in hypoglycemia, rather than hyperglycemia are associated with nerve fiber loss in diabetes.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning has recently become hugely popular in machine learning for its ability to solve end-to-end learning systems, in which the features and the classifiers are learned simultaneously, providing significant improvements in classification accuracy in the presence of highly-structured and large databases. Its success is due to a combination of recent algorithmic breakthroughs, increasingly powerful computers, and access to significant amounts of data. Researchers have also considered privacy implications of deep learning. Models are typically trained in a centralized manner with all the data being processed by the same training algorithm. If the data is a collection of users' private data, including habits, personal pictures, geographical positions, interests, and more, the centralized server will have access to sensitive information that could potentially be mishandled. To tackle this problem, collaborative deep learning models have recently been proposed where parties locally train their deep learning structures and only share a subset of the parameters in the attempt to keep their respective training sets private. Parameters can also be obfuscated via differential privacy ({DP}) to make information extraction even more challenging, as proposed by Shokri and Shmatikov at {CCS}'15. Unfortunately, we show that any privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning is susceptible to a powerful attack that we devise in this paper. In particular, we show that a distributed, federated, or decentralized deep learning approach is fundamentally broken and does not protect the training sets of honest participants. The attack we developed exploits the real-time nature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted training set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the {GAN} are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data). Interestingly, we show that record-level differential privacy applied to the shared parameters of the model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level {DP} is not designed to address our attack).},

	abstract = {Collaborative machine learning and related techniques such as federated learning allow multiple participants, each with his own training dataset, to build a joint model by training locally and periodically exchanging model updates. We demonstrate that these updates leak unintended information about participants' training data and develop passive and active inference attacks to exploit this leakage. First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points – for example, specific locations – in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier. We evaluate our attacks on a variety of tasks, datasets, and learning configurations, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible defenses.},

In a long time, people used to believe that gradients are safe to share: i.e, the training set will not be leaked by gradient sharing.  However, in this paper, we show that we can obtain the private training set from the publicly shared gradients.  The leaking only takes few gradient steps to process and can obtain the original training set instead of look-alike alternatives.  We name this leakage as {\textbackslash}textit\{deep leakage from gradient\}  and practically validate the effectiveness of our algorithm on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We empirically show that our attack is much stronger than previous approaches and thereby and raise people's awareness to rethink the gradients' safety. We also discuss some possible strategies to defend this deep leakage.},

	abstract = {Training deep neural networks requires gradient estimation from data batches to update parameters. Gradients per parameter are averaged over a set of data and this has been presumed to be safe for privacy-preserving training in joint, collaborative, and federated learning applications. Prior work only showed the possibility of recovering input data given gradients under very restrictive conditions – a single input point, or a network with no non-linearities, or a small 32 × 32 px input batch. Therefore, averaging gradients over larger batches was thought to be safe. In this work, we introduce {GradInversion}, using which input images from a larger batch (8 – 48 images) can also be recovered for large networks such as {ResNets} (50 layers), on complex datasets such as {ImageNet} (1000 classes, 224 × 224 px). We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of the original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via {GradInversion}, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes.},

	abstract = {The smart grid employs computing and communication technologies to embed intelligence into the power grid and, consequently, make the grid more efficient. Machine learning ({ML}) has been applied for tasks that are important for smart grid operation including energy consumption and generation forecasting, anomaly detection, and state estimation. These {ML} solutions commonly require sufficient historical data; however, this data is often not readily available because of reasons such as data collection costs and concerns regarding security and privacy. This paper introduces a recurrent generative adversarial network (R-{GAN}) for generating realistic energy consumption data by learning from real data. Generativea adversarial networks ({GANs}) have been mostly used for image tasks (e.g., image generation, super-resolution), but here they are used with time series data. Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) from image {GANs} are replaced with recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) because of {RNN}’s ability to capture temporal dependencies. To improve training stability and increase quality of generated data, Wasserstein {GANs} ({WGANs}) and Metropolis-Hastings {GAN} ({MH}-{GAN}) approaches were applied. The accuracy is further improved by adding features created with {ARIMA} and Fourier transform. Experiments demonstrate that data generated by R-{GAN} can be used for training energy forecasting models.},

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial "machine learning as a service" providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Deep neural network-based methods have recently achieved excellent performance in visual tracking task. As very few training samples are available in visual tracking task, those approaches rely heavily on extremely large auxiliary dataset such as {ImageNet} to pretrain the model. In order to address the discrepancy between the source domain (the auxiliary data) and the target domain (the object being tracked), they need to be finetuned during the tracking process. However, those methods suffer from sensitivity to the hyper-parameters such as learning rate, maximum number of epochs, size of mini-batch, and so on. Thus, it is worthy to investigate whether pretraining and fine tuning through conventional back-prop is essential for visual tracking. In this paper, we shed light on this line of research by proposing convolutional random vector functional link ({CRVFL}) neural network, which can be regarded as a marriage of the convolutional neural network and random vector functional link network, to simplify the visual tracking system. The parameters in the convolutional layer are randomly initialized and kept fixed. Only the parameters in the fully connected layer need to be learned. We further propose an elegant approach to update the tracker. In the widely used visual tracking benchmark, without any auxiliary data, a single {CRVFL} model achieves 79.0\% with a threshold of 20 pixels for the precision plot. Moreover, an ensemble of {CRVFL} yields comparatively the best result of 86.3\%.},

	abstract = {The edge of the smart grid has a massive number of power and resource-constrained interconnected devices. Mainly, smart meters report power consumption data from consumer homes, industrial buildings, and other connected infrastructures. Multiple approaches were proposed in the literature to preserve the privacy of consumers by altering the data via additive noise, masking, or other data obfuscation techniques. A significant body of work in the literature employs differential privacy methods with constraining predefined parameters to achieve the optimal trade-off between privacy and utility of the data. However, billing accuracy can be degraded by using such additive noise techniques. We propose a differentially-private model that perturbs data by adding noise obtained from a virtual chargeable battery, while maintaining billing accuracy. Our model utilizes fog-computing data aggregation with lightweight cryptographic primitives to ensure the authenticity and confidentiality of data generated by low-end devices. We describe our differentially-private model with flexible constraints and a dynamic window algorithm to maintain the privacy-budget loss in infinitely generated time-series data. Our experimental results show a possible decrease in data perturbation error by 51.7\% and 61.2\% for smart meters and fog-computing data aggregators perturbed data, respectively, compared to the commonly used Gaussian mechanism.},

Authentication procedures are among the main methods used to achieve this protection and, typically, are implemented only when accessing the device. Nevertheless, in many occasions it is necessary to carry out user authentication in a continuous manner to guarantee an allowed use of the device while protecting authentication data. In this work, we first review the state of the art of Continuous Authentication ({CA}), User Profiling ({UP}), and related biometric databases. Secondly, we summarize the privacy-preserving methods employed to protect the security of sensor-based data used to conduct user authentication, and some practical examples of their utilization. The analysis of the literature of these topics reveals the importance of sensor-based data to protect personal and professional information, as well as the need for exploring a combination of more biometric features with privacy-preserving approaches.},

	abstract = {As the tremendous advances in the biosensing technology, the biometric authentication approach has been adopted to replace the conventional password-based systems. Due to their harmless nature, photoplethysmogram ({PPG}) related applications have been quite intriguing in recent years. {PPG} can measure volumetric blood-flow changes in the peripheral circulation. Because {PPG} signals are very easy to acquire, compared to other biometrics (fingerprints, iris/retina, etc.), especially by low-cost wearable electronic devices, they are widely adopted to measure heart rates. In this paper, we devise a novel robust {PPG} based authentication system, which is capable of continuously authenticating the user instead of one-time authentication as carried out by the conventional techniques. This new system consists of preprocessing and filtering, motion artifact ({MA}) removal, template and feature extraction, and training. The associated multiwavelet-based feature extraction mechanism facilitates more reliable features than the conventional scalar-wavelet schemes so that it allows the learning model to better distinguish users. The associated autoencoder perfectly transforms the input {PPG} signal into the latent space. Finally, any distance measure can be adopted to classify or authenticate users. In order to build a sufficiently large dataset, we have combined three public datasets and our own dataset collected by ourselves locally together to create a new dataset consisting of 120 subjects totally. We have already built the hardware prototype successfully for real-time training data collection and real-time authentication. The equal-error-rate at the authentication stage reaches 5.5\% and the identification accuracy reaches 98\% at the identification stage.},

Interest in collaborative privacy-preserving forecasting is thus increasing. This paper analyzes the state-of-the-art and unveils several shortcomings of existing methods in guaranteeing data privacy when employing vector autoregressive models. The methods are divided into three groups: data transformation, secure multi-party computations, and decomposition methods. The analysis shows that state-of-the-art techniques have limitations in preserving data privacy, such as (i) the necessary trade-off between privacy and forecasting accuracy, empirically evaluated through simulations and real-world experiments based on solar data; and (ii) iterative model fitting processes, which reveal data after a number of iterations.},

In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an {ML} model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the {ML} model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of {CART} learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of {MI} attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

For example, a binary gender classifier of facial images also learns to recognize races{\textbackslash}textemdash even races that are not represented in the training data{\textbackslash}textemdash and identities. We demonstrate overlearning in several vision and {NLP} models and analyze its harmful consequences. First, inference-time representations of an overlearned model reveal sensitive attributes of the input, breaking privacy protections such as model partitioning. Second, an overlearned model can be "re-purposed" for a different, privacy-violating task even in the absence of the original training data. We show that overlearning is intrinsic for some tasks and cannot be prevented by censoring unwanted attributes. Finally, we investigate where, when, and why overlearning happens during model training.},

	abstract = {With the growing adoption of machine learning, sharing of learned models is becoming popular. However, in addition to the prediction properties the model producer aims to share, there is also a risk that the model consumer can infer other properties of the training data the model producer did not intend to share. In this paper, we focus on the inference of global properties of the training data, such as the environment in which the data was produced, or the fraction of the data that comes from a certain class, as applied to white-box Fully Connected Neural Networks ({FCNNs}). Because of their complexity and inscrutability, {FCNNs} have a particularly high risk of leaking unexpected information about their training sets; at the same time, this complexity makes extracting this information challenging. We develop techniques that reduce this complexity by noting that {FCNNs} are invariant under permutation of nodes in each layer. We develop our techniques using representations that capture this invariance and simplify the information extraction task. We evaluate our techniques on several synthetic and standard benchmark datasets and show that they are very effective at inferring various data properties. We also perform two case studies to demonstrate the impact of our attack. In the first case study we show that a classifier that recognizes smiling faces also leaks information about the relative attractiveness of the individuals in its training set. In the second case study we show that a classifier that recognizes Bitcoin mining from performance counters also leaks information about whether the classifier was trained on logs from machines that were patched for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.},

First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points – for example, specific locations – in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier. We evaluate our attacks on a variety of tasks, datasets, and learning configurations, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible defenses.},

This allows for predictive uncertainty estimation - crucial in applications like healthcare and weather forecasting. {NGBoost} generalizes gradient boosting to probabilistic regression by treating the parameters of the conditional distribution as targets for a multiparameter boosting algorithm. Furthermore, we show how the Natural Gradient is required to correct the training dynamics of our multiparameter boosting approach. {NGBoost} can be used with any base learner, any family of distributions with continuous parameters, and any scoring rule. {NGBoost} matches or exceeds the performance of existing methods for probabilistic prediction while offering additional benefits in flexibility, scalability, and usability.

	abstract = {With the development of smart electricity metering technologies, huge amounts of consumption data can be retrieved on a daily and hourly basis. Energy consumption forecasting facilitates electricity demand management and utilities load planning. Most studies have been focussed on commercial customers or residential building-level energy consumption, or have used behavioral and occupancy sensor data to characterize an individual household's electrical consumption. This study has analyzed energy consumption at single household level using smart meter data to improve residential energy services and gain insights into planning demand response programs. Electricity consumption for anonymous individual households has been predicted using a Support Vector Regression ({SVR}) modelling with both daily and hourly data granularity. The electricity usage data set for 2014 to 2016 was obtained from a Canadian utility company. Exploratory data analysis ({EDA}) was used for data visualization and feature selection. The analysis presented here demonstrates that forecasting residential energy consumption for individual households is feasible, but the accuracy is highly dependable on household behaviour variability.},

	abstract = {The integration of more renewable energy resources into distribution networks makes the operation of these systems more challenging compared to the traditional passive networks. This is mainly due to the intermittent behavior of most renewable resources such as solar and wind generation. There are many different solutions being developed to make systems flexible such as energy storage or demand response. In the context of demand response, a key factor is to estimate the amount of load over time properly to better manage the demand side. There are many different forecasting methods, but the most accurate solutions are mainly found for the prediction of aggregated loads at the substation or building levels. However, more effective demand response from the residential side requires prediction of energy consumption at every single household level. The accuracy of forecasting loads at this level is often lower with the existing methods as the volatility of single residential loads is very high. In this paper, we present a hybrid method based on time series image encoding techniques and a convolutional neural network. The results of the forecasting of a real residential customer using different encoding techniques are compared with some other existing forecasting methods including {SVM}, {ANN}, and {CNN}. Without {CNN}, the lowest mean absolute percentage of error ({MAPE}) for a 15 min forecast is above 20\%, while with existing {CNN}, directly applied to time series, an {MAPE} of around 18\% could be achieved. We find the best image encoding technique for time series, which could result in higher accuracy of forecasting using {CNN}, an {MAPE} of around 12\%.},

	abstract = {The use of Machine Learning ({ML}) techniques for malware detection has been a trend in the last two decades. More recently, researchers started to investigate adversarial approaches to bypass these {ML}-based malware detectors. Adversarial attacks became so popular that a large Internet company has launched a public challenge to encourage researchers to bypass their (three) {ML}-based static malware detectors. Our research group teamed to participate in this challenge in August/2019, accomplishing the bypass of all 150 tests proposed by the company. To do so, we implemented an automatic exploitation method which moves the original malware binary sections to resources and includes new chunks of data to it to create adversarial samples that not only bypassed their {ML} detectors, but also real {AV} engines as well (with a lower detection rate than the original samples). In this paper, we detail our methodological approach to overcome the challenge and report our findings. With these results, we expect to contribute with the community and provide better understanding on {ML}-based detectors weaknesses. We also pinpoint future research directions toward the development of more robust malware detectors against adversarial machine learning.},

During the contest’s first edition (2019), participating teams were challenged to bypass three {ML} models in a white box manner. Our team bypassed all the three of them and reported interesting insights about models’ weaknesses. In the second edition (2020), the challenge evolved to an attack-and-defense model: the teams should either propose defensive models and attack other teams’ models in a black box manner. Despite the difficulty increase, our team was able to bypass all models again. In this paper, we describe our insights for this year’s contest regarding on attacking models, as well defending them from adversarial attacks. In particular, we show how frequency-based models (e.g., {TF}-{IDF}) are vulnerable to the addition of dead function imports, and how models based on raw bytes are vulnerable to payload-embedding obfuscation (e.g., {XOR} and base64 encoding).},

Although the plethora of complex, unstructured and heterogeneous data is collected from various devices connected to the Internet, smart meters, plugs, sensors and complex questionnaires, there is an undoubted challenge to handle the data flow that does not provide much information as it remains unprocessed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an innovative methodology that organizes and extracts valuable information from the increasing volume of data, such as data about the electricity consumption measured and recorded at 30 min intervals, as well as data collected from complex questionnaires.},

	abstract = {A major issue in open-domain dialogue generation is the agent's tendency to generate repetitive and generic responses. The lack in response diversity has been addressed in recent years via the use of latent variable models, such as the Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder ({CVAE}), which typically involve learning a latent Gaussian distribution over potential response intents. However, due to latent variable collapse, training latent variable dialogue models are notoriously complex, requiring substantial modification to the standard training process and loss function. Other approaches proposed to improve response diversity also largely entail a significant increase in training complexity. Hence, this paper proposes a Randomized Link ({RL}) Transformer as an alternative to the latent variable models. The {RL} Transformer does not require any additional enhancements to the training process or loss function. Empirical results show that, when it comes to response diversity, the {RL} Transformer achieved comparable performance compared to latent variable models.},

Deep structure and learning suffer from a time-consuming training process because of a large number of connecting parameters in filters and layers. Moreover, it encounters a complete retraining process if the structure is not sufficient to model the system. The {BLS} is established in the form of a flat network, where the original inputs are transferred and placed as “mapped features” in feature nodes and the structure is expanded in wide sense in the “enhancement nodes.” The incremental learning algorithms are developed for fast remodeling in broad expansion without a retraining process if the network deems to be expanded. Two incremental learning algorithms are given for both the increment of the feature nodes (or filters in deep structure) and the increment of the enhancement nodes. The designed model and algorithms are very versatile for selecting a model rapidly. In addition, another incremental learning is developed for a system that has been modeled encounters a new incoming input. Specifically, the system can be remodeled in an incremental way without the entire retraining from the beginning. Satisfactory result for model reduction using singular value decomposition is conducted to simplify the final structure. Compared with existing deep neural networks, experimental results on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database and {NYU} {NORB} object recognition dataset benchmark data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed {BLS}.},

Typical prediction algorithms are based on artificial neural networks that require the computation of an activation function which is complicated to compute homomorphically.

Several authors have for instance focused on identifying groups of households with similar consumption patterns or on providing feedback to consumers in order to motivate them to reduce their energy consumption. In this paper, we propose to use electricity consumption data to classify households according to pre-defined "properties" of interest. Examples of these properties include the floor area of a household or the number of its occupants. Energy providers can leverage knowledge of such household properties to shape premium services (e.g., energy consulting) for their customers. We present a classification system - called {CLASS} - that takes as input electricity consumption data of a private household and provides as output the estimated values of its properties. We describe the design and implementation of {CLASS} and evaluate its performance. To this end, we rely on electricity consumption traces from 3,488 private households, collected at a 30-minute granularity and for a period of more than 1.5 years. Our evaluation shows that {CLASS} - relying on electricity consumption data only - can estimate the majority of the considered household properties with more than 70\% accuracy. For some of the properties, {CLASS}'s accuracy exceeds 80\%. Furthermore, we show that for selected properties the use of a priori information can increase classification accuracy by up to 11\%.},

A deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}) first automatically extracts features from massive load profiles. A support vector machine then identifies the characteristics of the consumers. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art and advanced machine learning techniques are conducted.

To gain benefits for various stakeholders in power systems, proper data mining techniques, such as clustering, need to be employed to extract the underlying patterns from energy consumptions. In this paper, a comparative study of different techniques for load pattern clustering is carried out. Different parameters of the methods that affect the clustering results are evaluated and the clustering algorithms are compared for two data sets. In addition, the two suitable and commonly used data size reduction techniques and feature definition/extraction methods for load pattern clustering are analysed. Furthermore, the existing studies on clustering of electricity customers are reviewed and the main results are highlighted. Finally, the future trends and major applications of clustering consumption patterns are outlined to inform industry practitioners and academic researchers to optimize smart meter operational use and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks ({FNNs}) are rare. {FNNs} that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks ({SNNs}) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of {SNNs} automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of {SNNs} are "scaled exponential linear units" ({SELUs}), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of {SNNs} allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared {SNNs} on (a) 121 tasks from the {UCI} machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard {FNNs} and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. {SNNs} significantly outperformed all competing {FNN} methods at 121 {UCI} tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning {SNN} architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/{SNNs}.},

By analyzing half-hourly meter data from over 4000 Irish households, this study seeks to examine the relationship between households’ attributes and their electricity demand through the following questions: (1) knowing a given set of household attributes, can we accurately classify households according to their demand volume and daily demand pattern and (2) can we infer some of the key households’ characteristics from their meter data. The attributes considered include the size, presence of kids, social class, employment status and the annual income of the households. A range of machine learning methods including tree-based algorithms, support vector machines and neural networks are deployed to answer these questions. The results suggest the potential for reasonably accurate segmentation of consumers according to their demand volume while the classification based on daily demand patterns were shown to be more challenging. For predicting household attributes, higher accuracy values are reported when predicting the household size, social class, and employment status. On the contrary, inferring the household income category and the presence of children in the household were shown to be more difficult.},

	abstract = {Technological advancements in the field of electrical energy distribution and utilization are revolutionizing the way consumers and utility providers interact. In addition to allowing utility companies to monitor the status of their network independently in autonomous fashion, data collected by smart meters as part of the wider advanced metering infrastructure, can be valuable for third parties, such as government authorities. The availability of the information, the granularity of the data, and the real-time nature of the smart meter, means that predictive analytics can be employed to profile consumers with high accuracy and approximate, for example, the number of individuals living in a house, the type of appliances being used, or the duration of occupancy, to name but a few applications. This paper presents a machine learning model comparison for unemployment prediction of single household occupants, based on features extracted from smart meter electricity readings. A number of nonlinear classifiers are compared, and benchmarked against a generalized linear model, and the results presented. To ensure the robustness of the classifiers, we use repeated cross validation. The results revealed that it is possible to predict employability status with Area Under Curve ({AUC}) = 74\%, Sensitivity ({SE}) = 54\% and Specificity ({SP}) = 83\%, using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout, closely followed by the results produced by a distance weighted discrimination with polynomial kernel model. This shows the potential of using the smart metering infrastructure to provide additional autonomous services, such as unemployment detection, for governments using data collected from an advanced and distributed Internet of Things ({IoT}) sensor network.},

In this setting, a large number of Smart Meters produces huge amounts of data that need to be processed to predict the load requested by the grid. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem, this often results in the adoption of simple aggregation strategies for the power that fail in capturing the relational information existing among the different types of user. A possible alternative, known as Cluster-based Aggregate Forecasting, consists in clustering the load profiles and, on top of that, building predictors of the aggregate at the cluster-level. In this work we explore the technique in the context of predictors based on deep recurrent neural networks and address the scalability issues presenting neural architectures adequate to process cluster-level aggregates. The proposed methods are finally evaluated both on a publicly available benchmark and a heterogenous dataset of Smart Meter data from an entire, medium-sized, Swiss town.},

Local demand profiles are volatile and noisy, making {STLF} difficult as we move towards lower levels of load aggregation. This paper examines in detail the correlations between demand and the variables which influence it, at various levels of load disaggregation. The analysis investigates the forecasting capability of both linear and non-linear {STLF} approaches for forecasting local demands, and quantifies the forecast uncertainty for each level of load aggregation. The results demonstrate the limitations of several of the most commonly-used {STLF} approaches in this context. It is shown that, at the local level, standard {STLF} models may not be effective, and that simple load models created from historical smart meter data can give similar prediction accuracies. The analysis in the paper is carried out using two large smart meter data sets recorded at distribution networks in Denmark and in Ireland.},

	abstract = {The abundance of energy consumption data collected by smart meters has inspired researchers to employ deep neural networks to solve the existing problems in the power industry, such as Short-Term Load Forecasting ({STLF}). Most studies addressing the {STLF} problem, focus on historical load data and to achieve higher performance, they supplement costly accessible environmental and calendar variables with data. This approach ignores the existing spatial information among the consumers which subsequently might lead into the emergence of similar consumption patterns. In this paper, we present a Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network, a novel neural architecture, for {STLF} problem that combines Graph Convolutional Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to simultaneously extract spatial and temporal information from users with similar consumption patterns. Our model captures spatial information from users without prior knowledge of their geographic location and does not rely on additional environmental variables. We compared our model to traditional baseline models for {STLF} using two real-world electricity consumption datasets. The empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction compared with the baseline models, exhibiting a 9.5\% and an 8\% improvement in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error, in the Customer Behavior Trials and Low Carbon London datasets, respectively.},

Emerging smart grid technologies pose new challenges and opportunities. Although load forecasting at the aggregate level has been extensively studied, electrical load forecasting at fine-grained geographical scales of households is more challenging. Among existing approaches, semi-parametric generalized additive models ({GAM}) have been increasingly popular due to their accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. Their applicability is justified when forecasting is addressed at higher levels of aggregation, since the aggregated load pattern contains relatively smooth additive components. High resolution data are highly volatile, forecasting the average load using {GAM} models with smooth components does not provide meaningful information about the future demand. Instead, we need to incorporate irregular and volatile effects to enhance the forecast accuracy. We focus on the analysis of such hybrid additive models applied on smart meters data and show that it leads to improvement of the forecasting performances of classical additive models at low aggregation levels.},

	doi = {10.1109/IranianCEE.2019.8786456},
	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are known as powerful tools for image processing. Although some works have used the {CNN} for processing of sequences such as time series, but they usually apply this type of data in the form of sequence that is not consistent with the {CNN} nature which receives inputs in the image (matrix) form. To deal with this problem, sequence to image transform based {CNN} ({STI}-{CNN}) is proposed in this work which transforms the load sequence to several images and feed them to the {CNN}. The proposed {STI}-{CNN} method is used for load forecasting. Transforming load sequence to load images results in some advantages. The main profit is that the lagged load values of load are located in a two-dimensional grid and {CNN} can extract informative features from the neighboring load variables. While in the sequence form, each load value just has two neighbors, each load value has 8 neighbors in the image form. The experiments implemented on the {ISSDA} dataset (an electrical load data from Ireland) show the superior performance of {STI}-{CNN} in terms of different forecasting measures.},

	abstract = {Future grid management systems will coordinate distributed production and storage resources to manage, in a cost effective fashion, the increased load and variability brought by the electrification of transportation and by a higher share of weather dependent production. Electricity demand forecasts at a low level of aggregation will be key inputs for such systems. We focus on forecasting demand at the individual household level, which is more challenging than forecasting aggregate demand, due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and to the heterogeneity of consumption patterns across households. We propose a new ensemble method for probabilistic forecasting which borrows strength across the households while accommodating their individual idiosyncrasies. In particular, we develop a set of models or “experts” which capture different demand dynamics, and we fit each of them to the data from each household. Then, we construct an aggregation of experts where the ensemble weights are estimated on the whole data set, the main innovation being that we let the weights vary with the covariates by adopting an additive model structure. In particular, the proposed aggregation method is an extension of regression stacking where the mixture weights are modelled using linear combinations of parametric, smooth or random effects. The methods for building and fitting additive stacking models are implemented by the {gamFactory} R package, available at https://github.com/mfasiolo/{gamFactory}.},

With the evolution of the smart grid and distributed energy resource concepts, the requirement of load profile data for planning has become critical. Conventional methods of collecting the load profile data, such as surveys and metering, are very tedious and time consuming activities. Consumer demand, as well as continuous technological evolution, contribute to rendering data obsolete in a short period of time. Furthermore, cumbersome data collection processes also pose barriers. In this paper, we present an innovative behavior model for generating electricity consumption load profiles. Our model requires minimum consumer data and can be easily updated to adapt to the changing technology. We demonstrate the accuracy of our model against real world data.},

The review highlights a substantial amount of literature covering the debate over the effectiveness of different feedback criteria to residential customer acceptance and overall conservation and peak demand reduction. Researchers studying the effects of feedback on everyday energy use have observed substantial variation in effect size, both within and between studies. Although researchers still continue to question the types of feedback that are most effective in encouraging conservation and peak load reduction, some trends have emerged. These include that feedback be received as quickly as possible to the time of consumption; be related to a standard; be clear and meaningful and where possible both direct and indirect feedback be customised to the customer. In general, the literature finds that feedback can reduce electricity consumption in homes by 5 to 20 percent, but that significant gaps remain in our knowledge of the effectiveness and cost benefit of feedback.},

The present paper is devoted to the development of a forecasting model based on the Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) method and an optimization model based on Genetic Algorithm ({GA}) adopted for the use in home energy management systems ({HEMS}). The present work describes a smart microgrid architecture with a focus on {LSTM} and {GA}. The experiments demonstrate that the developed algorithms generate a stable pattern of daily power demand. The use of the developed algorithms allows automated shifting of power to achieve the lowest price without sacrificing their comfort. The main contributions of the present work are the inclusion of all parts of the smart microgrid architecture (non-invasive load identification, forecasting, optimization, renewable energy sources and storage elements) in the research proposing a fully automated control in {HEMS} rather than recommendation based only.},

If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention. This article serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the current technological progress in anomaly detection of energy consumption based on artificial intelligence.},

We compare the accuracy of this approach with two machine learning approaches, random forest and neural networks, and with a statistical approach, the {ARIMA} model. We study whether these approaches detect the same anomalous periods. These different techniques have been evaluated using a real dataset obtained from different households with different consumption profiles from the Madrid Region. The entropy-based algorithm detects more days classified as anomalous according to context information compared to the other algorithms. This approach has the advantages that it does not require a training period and that it adapts dynamically to changes, except in vacation periods when consumption drops drastically and requires some time for adapting to the new situation.},

Deep 2D {CNNs} with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D {CNNs} have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D {CNNs} that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D {CNNs} along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D {CNN} software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D {CNNs} and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

In this paper, we introduce direct input-to-output connections ({DIOCs}) into the {ElmanNN} and show that the proposed Elman neural network with {DIOCs} (Elman-{DIOCs}) significantly out-performs the original {ElmanNN} without such {DIOCs}. Four different global stock indices, i.e., the Shanghai Stock Exchange ({SSE}) Composite Index, the Korea Stock Price Index ({KOSPI}), the Nikkei 225 Index (Nikkei225), and the Standard \& Poor’s 500 Index ({SPX}), are used to demonstrate the affecacy of the Elman-{DIOCs} in time-series prediction. We systematically evaluate 8 models, depending whether or not there are hidden layer biases, whether or not there are output layer biases, and whether or not there are {DIOCs}. The experimental results show that {DIOCs} lead to much better prediction accuracy, while requiring fewer than a half of the hidden neurons. Take the {SPX} index, for example - the root mean squared error ({RMSE}) and the mean absolute error ({MAE}) of the Elman-{DIOCs} are improved by 44.2\% and 41.1\%, respectively, compared to the {ElmanNN}, and 65.6\% and 60.8\%, respectively, compared to the multi-layer perceptron ({MLP}). We argue that (1) {DIOCs} can always help to improve accuracy, while reducing network complexity and computational burden, as long as the problem at hand (either regression or classification) has linear components, and (2) most real-world applications contain linear components. Therefore {DIOCs} will be almost always beneficial in any types of neural networks for classification or regression. We also point out that in rare cases where the problem at hand is entirely nonlinear, {DIOCs} should not be used.},

Eight different datasets were used to verify the validity of {BPNN}–{DIOC} model in time series prediction. In this paper, the {BPNN} was extended to four variants based on the presence or absence of output layer bias and input-to-output connections firstly, and the prediction accuracy of eight datasets are analyzed by statistic method secondly.

This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats ({APTs}), are those that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself against. While nation-sponsored {APT} attacks will always be marked by their sophistication, {APT} attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to perform {APT}, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of {APT} attacker(s) are required. Several works have been published on detecting an {APT} attack at one or two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting {APT} as a whole from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks. Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that could be used to detect different stages of {APT} attacks, learning methods that need to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable for those adapting {APT} attackers. We also present different case studies of {APT} attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for fine-grained control of security of a networked system. We conclude this paper with different challenges in defending against {APT} and opportunities for further research, ending with a note on what we learned during our writing of this paper.},

In this scheme, considering the characteristics of long attack sequences and long-term continuous {APT} attacks, our solution adopts a well-known deep learning model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers ({BERT}), to detect {APT} attack sequences. The {APT} attack sequence is also optimized to ensure the model's long-term sequence judgment effectiveness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed deep learning method has feasibility and effectiveness for {APT} detection, but also certify that the {BERT} model has better accuracy and a lower false alarm rate when detecting {APT} attack sequences than other time series models.},

	shorttitle = {Network traffic analysis through node behaviour classification},
	abstract = {Network traffic analysis is an important cybersecurity task, which helps to classify anomalous, potentially dangerous connections. In many cases, it is critical not only to detect individual malicious connections, but to detect which node in a network has generated malicious traffic so that appropriate actions can be taken to reduce the threat and increase the system’s cybersecurity. Instead of analysing connections only, node behavioural analysis can be performed by exploiting the graph information encoded in a connection network. Network traffic, however, is temporal data and extracting graph information without a fixed time scope may only unveil macro-dynamics that are less related to cybersecurity threats. To address these issues, a threefold approach is proposed here: firstly, temporal dissection for extracting graph-based information is applied. As the resulting graphs are typically affected by class imbalance (i.e. malicious nodes are under-represented), two novel graph data-level preprocessing techniques - R-hybrid and {SM}-hybrid - are introduced, which focus on exploiting the most relevant graph substructures. Finally, a Neural Network ({NN}) and two Graph Convolutional Network ({GCN}) approaches are compared when performing node behaviour classification. Furthermore, we compare the node classification performance of these supervised models with traditional unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. Results show that temporal dissection parameters affected classification performance, while the data-level preprocessing strategies reduced class imbalance and led to improved supervised node behaviour classification, outperforming anomaly detection models. In particular, Neural Network ({NN}) outperformed Graph Convolutional Network ({GCN}) approaches for two attack families and was less affected by class imbalance, yet one {GCN} performed best overall. The presented study successfully applies a temporal graph-based approach for malicious actor detection in network traffic data.},

Real network traffic was tested to analyze the effects of the model structure and external noise on the detection performance, and the experimental results verified the correctness of the proposed method.

	abstract = {Various attacks have emerged as the major threats to the success of a connected world like the Internet of Things ({IoT}), in which billions of devices interact with each other to facilitate human life. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of cheap and insecure devices such as {IP} cameras, an attacker can create hundreds of thousands of zombie devices and then launch massive volume attacks to take down any target. For example, in 2016, a record large-scale {DDoS} attack launched by millions of Mirai-injected {IP} cameras and smart printers blocked the accessibility of several high-profile websites. To date, the state-of-the-art defense systems against such attacks rely mostly on pre-defined features extracted from the entire flows or signatures. The feature definitions are manual, and it would be too late to block a malicious flow after extracting the flow features. In this work, we present an effective anomaly traffic detection mechanism, namely D-{PACK}, which consists of a Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) and an unsupervised deep learning model (e.g., Autoencoder) for auto-profiling the traffic patterns and filtering abnormal traffic. Notably, D-{PACK} inspects only the first few bytes of the first few packets in each flow for early detection. Our experimental results show that, by examining just the first two packets in each flow, D-{PACK} still performs with nearly 100\% accuracy, while features an extremely low false-positive rate, e.g., 0.83\%. The design can inspire the emerging efforts towards online anomaly detection systems that feature reducing the volume of processed packets and blocking malicious flows in time.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is being embraced by information security researchers and organizations alike for its potential in detecting attacks that an organization faces, specifically attacks that go undetected by traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. Along with the ability to process large amounts of data, machine learning brings the potential to detect contextual and collective anomalies, an essential attribute of an ideal threat detection system. Datasets play a vital role in developing machine learning models that are capable of detecting complex and sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats ({APT}). However, there is currently no {APT}-dataset that can be used for modeling and detecting {APT} attacks. Characterized by the sophistication involved and the determined nature of the {APT} attackers, these threats are not only difficult to detect but also to model. Generic intrusion datasets have three key limitations - (1) They capture attack traffic at the external endpoints, limiting their usefulness in the context of {APTs} which comprise of attack vectors within the internal network as well (2) The difference between normal and anomalous behavior is quiet distinguishable in these datasets and thus fails to represent the sophisticated attackers’ of {APT} attacks (3) The data imbalance in existing datasets do not reflect the real-world settings rendering themselves as a benchmark for supervised models and falling short of semi-supervised learning. To address these concerns, in this paper, we propose a dataset {DAPT} 2020 which consists of attacks that are part of Advanced Persistent Threats ({APT}). These attacks (1) are hard to distinguish from normal traffic flows but investigate the raw feature space and (2) comprise of traffic on both public-to-private interface and the internal (private) network. Due to the existence of severe class imbalance, we benchmark {DAPT} 2020 dataset on semi-supervised models and show that they perform poorly trying to detect attack traffic in the various stages of an {APT}.},

	abstract = {Unraveled is a novel cybersecurity dataset capturing Advanced Persistent Threat ({APT}) attacks not available in the public domain. Existing cybersecurity datasets lack coherent information about sophisticated and persistent cyber-attack features, including attack planning and deployment, stealthiness of the attacker(s), longer dorm period between attack activities, etc. Our {APT} attack scenario in Unraveled is implemented on a real network system established on a cloud platform to emulate an organization’s network system. The new dataset provides a comprehensive network flow and host-level log information about the normal user(s) traffic and the cyber attacks traffic. To emulate realistic network traffic scenarios, Unraveled also includes attacks at different skills reflecting a typical organization’s threat posture, and by utilizing {APT} attack information from one of the well-known {APT} attack databases, i.e., {MITRE}’s {APT}-group database. Furthermore, we design and develop an Employee Behavior Generation ({EBG}) model to emulate multiple normal employees’ traffic and activities during a 6-week time period based on their pre-defined business functions. Using well-known machine learning models for anomaly detection, we show that the {APT} attack activities in Unraveled are hardly detected, indicating the need for more effective solutions that are based on datasets representing real world {APT} attacks.},

To assist reviewers, we present a simple unsupervised technique for using language models ({LMs}) to identify procedural anomalies in long-form legal text. Our technique highlights unusual passages that suggest further review could be necessary. We utilize a contrastive perplexity score to identify passages, defined as the scaled difference between its perplexities from two {LMs}, one fine-tuned on the target (parole) domain, and another pre-trained on out-of-domain text to normalize for grammatical or syntactic anomalies. We present quantitative analysis of the results and note that our method has identified some important cases for review.

	abstract = {Computer networks target several kinds of attacks every hour and day; they evolved to make significant risks. They pass new attacks and trends; these attacks target every open port available on the network. Several tools are designed for this purpose, such as mapping networks and vulnerabilities scanning. Recently, machine learning ({ML}) is a widespread technique offered to feed the Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}) to detect malicious network traffic. The core of {ML} models’ detection efficiency relies on the dataset’s quality to train the model. This research proposes a detection framework with an {ML} model for feeding {IDS} to detect network traffic anomalies. This detection model uses a dataset constructed from malicious and normal traffic. This research’s significant challenges are the extracted features used to train the {ML} model about various attacks to distinguish whether it is an anomaly or regular traffic. The dataset {ISOT}-{CID} network traffic part uses for the training {ML} model. We added some significant column features, and we approved that feature supports the {ML} model in the training phase. The {ISOT}-{CID} dataset traffic part contains two types of features, the first extracted from network traffic flow, and the others computed in specific interval time. We also presented a novel column feature added to the dataset and approved that it increases the detection quality. This feature is depending on the rambling packet payload length in the traffic flow. Our presented results and experiment produced by this research are significant and encourage other researchers and us to expand the work as future work.},

	abstract = {Monitoring traffic in computer networks is one of the core approaches for defending critical infrastructure against cyber attacks. Machine Learning ({ML}) and Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) have been proposed in the past as a tool to identify anomalies in computer networks. Although detecting these anomalies provides an indication of an attack, just detecting an anomaly is not enough information for a user to understand the anomaly. The black-box nature of off-the-shelf {ML} models prevents extracting important information that is fundamental to isolate the source of the fault/attack and take corrective measures. In this paper, we introduce the Network Transformer ({NeT}), a {DNN} model for anomaly detection that incorporates the graph structure of the communication network in order to improve interpretability. The presented approach has the following advantages: 1) enhanced interpretability by incorporating the graph structure of computer networks; 2) provides a hierarchical set of features that enables analysis at different levels of granularity; 3) self-supervised training that does not require labeled data. The presented approach was tested by evaluating the successful detection of anomalies in an Industrial Control System ({ICS}). The presented approach successfully identified anomalies, the devices affected, and the specific connections causing the anomalies, providing a data-driven hierarchical approach to analyze the behavior of a cyber network.},

	abstract = {Advanced persistent threat ({APT}) attack is a malicious attack type which has intentional and clear targets. This attack technique has become a challenge for information security systems of organizations, governments, and businesses. The approaches of using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze signs and abnormal behaviors of network traffic for detecting and preventing {APT} attacks have become popular in recent years. However, the {APT} attack detection approach that uses behavior analysis and evaluation techniques is facing many difficulties due to the lack of typical data of attack campaigns. To handle this situation, recent studies have selected and extracted the {APT} attack behaviors which based on datasets are built from experimental tools. Consequently, these properties are few and difficult to obtain in practical monitoring systems. Therefore, although the experimental results show good detection, it does not bring high efficiency in practice. For above reasons, in this paper, a new method based on network traffic analysis using a combined deep learning model to detect {APT} attacks will be proposed. Specifically, individual deep learning networks such as multilayer perceptron ({MLP}), convolutional neural network ({CNN}), and long short-term memory ({LSTM}) will also be sought, built and linked into combined deep learning networks to analyze and detect signs of {APT} attacks in network traffic. To detect {APT} attack signals, the combined deep learning models are performed in two main stages including (i) extracting {IP} features based on flow: In this phase, we will analyze network traffic into networking flows by {IP} address and then use the combined deep learning models to extract {IP} features by network flow; (ii) classifying {APT} attack {IPs}: Based on {IP} features extracted in a task (i), the {APT} attack {IPs} and normal {IPs} will be identified and classified. The proposal of a combined deep learning model to detect {APT} attacks based on network traffic is a new approach, and there is no research proposed and applied yet. In the experimental section, combined deep learning models proved their superior abilities to ensure accuracy on all measurements from 93 to 98\%. This is a very good result for {APT} attack detection based on network traffic.},

One of the typical types of attacks that has increasingly occurred is the {APT} attack (Advanced Persistent Threat). {APT} is dangerous with clear purposes. {APT} attacks employ different sophisticated methods and techniques attacking targets in order to steal confidential and sensitive information. In the past, hackers attacked information systems with personal and financial motives. However, there are nowadays other motives such as political ones and they are potentially backed by governments or nations. Nations that own advanced technologies such as United States, India, Russia, {UK} are also suffering from special purpose attacks. {APT} is an advanced type of attacks that consists of many stages and concrete strategies. Besides, techniques and technologies employed in {APT} attack are usually new and developed by hackers in order to break through the monitoring of security software. However, {APT} is normally implemented through concrete steps and stages. If one of the steps or stages fails, the entire {APT} attack will fail.

Web traffic anomalies represent abnormal changes in time series traffic, and it is important to perform detection quickly and accurately for the efficient operation of complex computer networks systems. In this paper, we propose a C-{LSTM} neural network for effectively modeling the spatial and temporal information contained in traffic data, which is a one-dimensional time series signal. We also provide a method for automatically extracting robust features of spatial-temporal information from raw data. Experiments demonstrate that our C-{LSTM} method can extract more complex features by combining a convolutional neural network ({CNN}), long short-term memory ({LSTM}), and deep neural network ({DNN}). The {CNN} layer is used to reduce the frequency variation in spatial information; the {LSTM} layer is suitable for modeling time information; and the {DNN} layer is used to map data into a more separable space. Our C-{LSTM} method also achieves nearly perfect anomaly detection performance for web traffic data, even for very similar signals that were previously considered to be very difficult to classify. Finally, the C-{LSTM} method outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on Yahoo's well-known Webscope S5 dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.6\% and recall of 89.7\% on the test dataset.},

	abstract = {We show that a recurrent neural network is able to learn a model to represent sequences of communications between computers on a network and can be used to identify outlier network traffic. Defending computer networks is a challenging problem and is typically addressed by manually identifying known malicious actor behavior and then specifying rules to recognize such behavior in network communications. However, these rule-based approaches often generalize poorly and identify only those patterns that are already known to researchers. An alternative approach that does not rely on known malicious behavior patterns can potentially also detect previously unseen patterns. We tokenize and compress netflow into sequences of "words" that form "sentences" representative of a conversation between computers. These sentences are then used to generate a model that learns the semantic and syntactic grammar of the newly generated language. We use Long-Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) cell Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNN}) to capture the complex relationships and nuances of this language. The language model is then used predict the communications between two {IPs} and the prediction error is used as a measurement of how typical or atyptical the observed communication are. By learning a model that is specific to each network, yet generalized to typical computer-to-computer traffic within and outside the network, a language model is able to identify sequences of network activity that are outliers with respect to the model. We demonstrate positive unsupervised attack identification performance ({AUC} 0.84) on the {ISCX} {IDS} dataset which contains seven days of network activity with normal traffic and four distinct attack patterns.},

	abstract = {Driving event detection and driver behavior recognition have been widely explored for many purposes, including detecting distractions, classifying driver actions, detecting kidnappings, pricing vehicle insurance, evaluating eco-driving, and managing shared and leased vehicles. Some systems can recognize the main driving events (e.g., accelerating, braking, and turning) by using in-vehicle devices, such as inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) sensors. In general, feature extraction is a commonly used technique to obtain robust and meaningful information from the sensor signals to guarantee the effectiveness of the subsequent classification algorithm. However, a general assessment of deep neural networks merits further investigation, particularly regarding end-to-end models based on Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}), which combine two components, namely feature extraction and the classification parts. This paper primarily explores supervised deep-learning models based on 1D and 2D {CNNs} to classify driving events from the signals of linear acceleration and angular velocity obtained with the {IMU} sensors of a smartphone placed in the instrument panel of the vehicle. Aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors can be recognized by monitoring driving events, such as accelerating, braking, lane changing, and turning. The experimental results obtained are promising since the best classification model achieved accuracy values of up to 82.40\%, and macro- and micro-average F1 scores, respectively, equal to 75.36\% and 82.40\%, thus, demonstrating high performance in the classification of driving events.},

	abstract = {In recent years, sensors in the Internet of things have been commonly used in Human’s life. {APT} (Advanced Persistent Threats) has caused serious damage to network security and the sensors play an important role in the attack process. For a long time, attackers infiltrate, attack, conceal, spread, and steal information of target groups through the compound use of various attacking means, while existing security measures based on single-time nodes cannot defend against such attacks. Attackers often exploit the sensors’ vulnerabilities to attack targets because the security level of the sensors is relatively low when compared with that of the host. We can find {APT} attacks by checking the suspicious domains generated at different {APT} attack stages, since every {APT} attack has to use {DNS} to communicate. Although this method works, two challenges still exist: (1) the detection method needs to check a large scale of log data; (2) the small number of attacking samples limits conventional supervised learning. This paper proposes an {APT} detection framework {AULD} (Advanced Persistent Threats Unsupervised Learning Detection) to detect suspicious domains in {APT} attacks by using unsupervised learning. We extract ten important features from the host, domain name, and time from a large number of {DNS} log data. Later, we get the suspicious cluster by performing unsupervised learning. We put all of the domains in the cluster into the list of malicious domains. We collected 1,584,225,274 {DNS} records from our university network. The experiments show that {AULD} detected all of the attacking samples and that {AULD} can effectively detect the suspicious domain names in {APT} attacks.},

	abstract = {Domain name system ({DNS}), as one of the most critical internet infrastructure, has been abused by various cyber attacks. Current malicious domain detection capabilities are limited by insufficient credible label information, severe class imbalance, and incompact distribution of domain samples in different malicious activities. This paper proposes a malicious domain detection framework named {PUMD}, which innovatively introduces Positive and Unlabeled ({PU}) learning solution to solve the problem of insufficient label information, adopts customized sample weight to improve the impact of class imbalance, and effectively constructs evidence features based on resource overlapping to reduce the intra-class distance of malicious samples. Besides, a feature selection strategy based on permutation importance and binning is proposed to screen the most informative detection features. Finally, we conduct experiments on the open source real {DNS} traffic dataset provided by {QI}-{ANXIN} Technology Group to evaluate the {PUMD} framework’s ability to capture potential command and control (C\&C) domains for malicious activities. The experimental results prove that {PUMD} can achieve the best detection performance under different label frequencies and class imbalance ratios.},

	abstract = {Electricity theft is harmful to power grids. Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and deep {CNN} model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep {CNN} component. The deep {CNN} component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity consumption data. As a result, wide and deep {CNN} model can achieve the excellent performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic dataset show that wide and deep {CNN} model outperforms other existing methods.},

Accordingly, in the proposed method, multivariate time series data which include hourly load data, hourly temperature time series and fuzzified version of load time series, was converted into multi-channel images to be fed to a proposed deep learning {CNN} model with proper architecture. By using images which have been created from the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed {CNN} model could determine and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some traditional {STLF} models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of {STLF}. Moreover, using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of presenting it with exact numbers. Various experiments on test data-sets support the efficiency of the proposed method.},

A transformation matrix of each layer is obtained by solving an optimization aimed at a better representation where a subsequent layer builds its representation on the top of the features produced by a previous layer. We compared the performance of our approach with a {DNN} trained using back-propagation which has same architecture as ours. Experimental results on the real image datasets demonstrate efficacy of our approach. We also performed kernel analysis of layer representations to validate the claim of better feature encoding.},

	abstract = {Extreme learning machine ({ELM}) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using {ELM} may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new {ELM}-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an {ELM}-based sparse autoencoder is developed via ℓ1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original {ELM}; 2) by exploiting the advantages of {ELM} random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning ({DL}), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the {DL}. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.},

	abstract = {Recent analyses (Bengio, Delalleau, \& Le Roux, 2006; Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007) of modern nonparametric machine learning algorithms that are kernel machines, such as Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), graph-based manifold and semi-supervised learning algorithms suggest fundamental limitations of some learning algorithms. The problem is clear in kernel-based approaches when the kernel is "local" (e.g., the Gaussian kernel), i.e., K (x, y ) converges to a constant when {\textbar}{\textbar}x - y {\textbar}{\textbar} increases. These analyses point to the difficulty of learning "highly-varying functions", i.e., functions that have a large number of "variations" in the domain of interest, e.g., they would require a large number of pieces to be well represented by a piecewise-linear approximation. Since the number of pieces can be made to grow exponentially with the number of factors of variations in the input, this is connected with the well-known curse of dimensionality for classical non-parametric learning algorithms (for regression, classification and density estimation). If the shapes of all these pieces are unrelated, one needs enough examples for each piece in order to generalize properly. However, if these shapes are related and can be predicted from each other, "non-local" learning algorithms have the potential to generalize to pieces not covered by the training set. Such ability would seem necessary for learning in complex domains such as Artificial Intelligence tasks (e.g., related to vision, language, speech, robotics). Kernel machines (not only those with a local kernel) have a shallow architecture, i.e., only two levels of data-dependent computational elements. This is also true of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer (which can become {SVMs} when the number of hidden units becomes large (Bengio, Le Roux, Vincent, Delalleau, \& Marcotte, 2006)). A serious problem with shallow architectures is that they can be very inefficient in terms of the number of computational units (e.g., bases, hidden units), and thus in terms of required examples (Bengio \& Le Cun, 2007). One way to represent a highly-varying function compactly (with few parameters) is through the composition of many non-linearities, i.e., with a deep architecture. For example, the parity function with d inputs requires O(2d ) examples and parameters to be represented by a Gaussian {SVM} (Bengio et al., 2006), O(d2 ) parameters for a one-hidden-layer neural network, O(d) parameters and units for a multi-layer network with O(log2 d) layers, and O(1) parameters with a recurrent neural network.

Recently, some contributions have proposed techniques to endow the networks with early exits, allowing to obtain predictions at intermediate points of the stack. These multi-output networks have a number of advantages, including (i) significant reductions of the inference time, (ii) reduced tendency to overfitting and vanishing gradients, and (iii) capability of being distributed over multi-tier computation platforms. In addition, they connect to the wider themes of biological plausibility and layered cognitive reasoning. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive introduction to this family of neural networks, by describing in a unified fashion the way these architectures can be designed, trained, and actually deployed in time-constrained scenarios. We also describe in-depth their application scenarios in 5G and Fog computing environments, as long as some of the open research questions connected to them.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are state of the art methods for many learning tasks due to their ability to extract increasingly better features at each network layer. However, the improved performance of additional layers in a deep network comes at the cost of added latency and energy usage in feedforward inference. As networks continue to get deeper and larger, these costs become more prohibitive for real-time and energy-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we present {BranchyNet}, a novel deep network architecture that is augmented with additional side branch classifiers. The architecture allows prediction results for a large portion of test samples to exit the network early via these branches when samples can already be inferred with high confidence. {BranchyNet} exploits the observation that features learned at an early layer of a network may often be sufficient for the classification of many data points. For more difficult samples, which are expected less frequently, {BranchyNet} will use further or all network layers to provide the best likelihood of correct prediction. We study the {BranchyNet} architecture using several well-known networks ({LeNet}, {AlexNet}, {ResNet}) and datasets ({MNIST}, {CIFAR}10) and show that it can both improve accuracy and significantly reduce the inference time of the network.},

The main idea is that layers can be trained one at a time, and once they are trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new data set, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. We call this forward thinking and demonstrate a proof of concept by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the {MNIST} dataset for convolutional neural networks.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach for efficient training of deep neural networks in a bottom-up fashion using a layered structure. Our algorithm, which we refer to as deep cascade learning, is motivated by the cascade correlation approach of Fahlman and Lebiere, who introduced it in the context of perceptrons. We demonstrate our algorithm on networks of convolutional layers, though its applicability is more general. Such training of deep networks in a cascade directly circumvents the well-known vanishing gradient problem by ensuring that the output is always adjacent to the layer being trained. We present empirical evaluations comparing our deep cascade training with standard end-end training using back propagation of two convolutional neural network architectures on benchmark image classification tasks ({CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100). We then investigate the features learned by the approach and find that better, domain-specific, representations are learned in early layers when compared to what is learned in end-end training. This is partially attributable to the vanishing gradient problem that inhibits early layer filters to change significantly from their initial settings. While both networks perform similarly overall, recognition accuracy increases progressively with each added layer, with discriminative features learned in every stage of the network, whereas in end-end training, no such systematic feature representation was observed. We also show that such cascade training has significant computational and memory advantages over end-end training, and can be used as a pretraining algorithm to obtain a better performance.},

	abstract = {We characterize a prevalent weakness of deep neural networks ({DNNs})---overthinking---which occurs when a {DNN} can reach correct predictions before its final layer. Overthinking is computationally wasteful, and it can also be destructive when, by the final layer, a correct prediction changes into a misclassification. Understanding overthinking requires studying how each prediction evolves during a {DNN}'s forward pass, which conventionally is opaque. For prediction transparency, we propose the Shallow-Deep Network ({SDN}), a generic modification to off-the-shelf {DNNs} that introduces internal classifiers. We apply {SDN} to four modern architectures, trained on three image classification tasks, to characterize the overthinking problem. We show that {SDNs} can mitigate the wasteful effect of overthinking with confidence-based early exits, which reduce the average inference cost by more than 50\% and preserve the accuracy. We also find that the destructive effect occurs for 50\% of misclassifications on natural inputs and that it can be induced, adversarially, with a recent backdooring attack. To mitigate this effect, we propose a new confusion metric to quantify the internal disagreements that will likely lead to misclassifications.},

Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They effectively model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of {LSTMs} to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple {LSTM} network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective training strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step.

We prove that the training error decays exponentially with the depth {TTT} if the weak module classifiers that we train perform slightly better than some weak baseline. In other words, we propose a weak learning condition and prove a boosting theory for {ResNet} under the weak learning condition.

The characteristics are related to a household's socio-economic status, its dwelling, or its appliance stock. We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-min granularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70\% over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80\% for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure. The inferred knowledge paves the way for targeted energy efficiency programs and other services that benefit from improved customer insights. On the basis of these promising results, the paper discusses the potential for utilities as well as policy and privacy implications.},

	abstract = {Accurate household profiles (e.g., house type, number of occupants) identification is the key to the successful implementation of behavioral demand response. Currently, supervised learning methods are widely adopted to identify household profiles using smart meter data. Such methods could achieve promising performance in the case of sufficient labeled data but show low accuracy if labeled data is insufficient or even unavailable. However, the acquisition of accurately labeled data (usually obtained by survey) is very difficult, costly, and time-consuming in practice due to various reasons such as privacy concerns. To this end, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed in this paper to address the above issues. Firstly, 78 preliminary features reflecting the household profiles information are extracted from both time and frequency domain. Secondly, feature selection methods are introduced to select more relevant ones as the input of the identification model from the preliminary features. Thirdly, a transductive support vector machine method is adopted to learn the mapping relation between the input features and the output household profile identification results. Case study on an Irish dataset indicates that the proposed approach outperforms supervised learning methods when only limited labeled data is available. Furthermore, the impacts of different feature selection methods (i.e., Filter, Wrapper and Embedding methods) are also investigated, among which the wrapper method performs best, and the identification accuracy improves with the increase of data resolution.},

As a key component of the distribution grid monitoring systems, smart meters installed at each customer’s household offer a non-intrusive approach to predict the household characteristics. The resolution of energy consumption data has a great impact on prediction accuracy as fine granularity data can better characterize the household energy usage profile features. However, collecting high-resolution energy consumption data may not be feasible for power utilities due to the substantial cost of upgrading the existing Advanced Metering Infrastructure ({AMI}). This paper aims to propose a cost-effective framework for the accurate prediction of household characteristics by realizing the multifractal characteristics of residential electric energy consumption data recorded from smart meters. First, Multiscale Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ({MMV}-{MFDFA}) is performed on the energy consumption data to analyze the multiscale relationships of the residential energy usage profile and reveal the multifractal structures embedded in the energy data. Then, Self-Adaptive Multifractal Interpolation ({SAMI}) is developed to reconstruct quasi high-resolution energy consumption data from which distinctive features relevant to household characteristics are extracted by Mathematical Morphological Decomposition ({MMD}). Such features are further integrated with an advanced deep learning algorithm - Deep Forest ({DF}) for household characteristic prediction. The proposed method is validated using real-life smart meter data from Ireland.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	abstract = {Today, artificial neural networks are the state of the art for solving a variety of complex tasks, especially in image classification. Such architectures consist of a sequence of stacked layers with the aim of extracting useful information and having it processed by a classifier to make accurate predictions. However, intermediate information within such models is often left unused. In other cases, such as in edge computing contexts, these architectures are divided into multiple partitions that are made functional by including early exits, i.e. intermediate classifiers, with the goal of reducing the computational and temporal load without extremely compromising the accuracy of the classifications. In this paper, we present Anticipate, Ensemble and Prune ({AEP}), a new training technique based on weighted ensembles of early exits, which aims at exploiting the information in the structure of networks to maximise their performance. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we show how the use of this approach can yield average accuracy improvements of up to 15\% over traditional training. In its hybrid-weighted configuration, {AEP}'s internal pruning operation also allows reducing the number of parameters by up to 41\%, lowering the number of multiplications and additions by 18\% and the latency time to make inference by 16\%. By using {AEP}, it is also possible to learn weights that allow early exits to achieve better accuracy values than those obtained from single-output reference models.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is increasingly used for decision-making in health applications. However, commonly used deep learning models are deterministic and are unable to provide any estimate of predictive uncertainty. Quantifying model uncertainty is crucial for reducing the risk of misdiagnosis by informing practitioners of low-confident predictions. To address this issue, we propose early exit ensembles, a novel framework capable of capturing predictive uncertainty via an implicit ensemble of early exits. We evaluate our approach on the task of classification using three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures applied to three medical imaging datasets. Our experiments show that early exit ensembles provide better-calibrated uncertainty compared to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles using just a single forward-pass of the model. Depending on the dataset and baseline, early exit ensembles can improve uncertainty metrics up to 2x, while increasing accuracy by up to 2\% over its single model counterpart. Finally, our results suggest that by providing well-calibrated predictive uncertainty for both in- and out-of-distribution inputs, early exit ensembles have the potential to improve trustworthiness of models in high-risk medical decision-making.},

Using ensembles in compute-constrained applications would be much more practical if just a subset of the models could be evaluated. We address this issue with a novel product-of-experts-based method for early-exit ensembling. We rely on the fact that the product of finite-support probability distributions (e.g., the continuous uniform) has support less than or equal to that of the multiplicands. Thus, by setting a confidence threshold, we can stop evaluating ensemble members once the size of the support has been sufficiently reduced. We demonstrate our methodology for both realvalue regression and multi-class classification.},

Specifically, we propose {OccamNets}, which are biased to favor simpler solutions by design. {OccamNets} have two inductive biases. First, they are biased to use as little network depth as needed for an individual example. Second, they are biased toward using fewer image locations for prediction. While {OccamNets} are biased toward simpler hypotheses, they can learn more complex hypotheses if necessary. In experiments, {OccamNets} outperform or rival state-of-the-art methods run on architectures that do not incorporate these inductive biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the state-of-the-art debiasing methods are combined with {OccamNets} results further improve.},

	abstract = {Deploying Machine learning ({ML}) on the milliwatt-scale edge devices ({tinyML}) is gaining popularity due to recent breakthroughs in {ML} and {IoT}. However, the capabilities of {tinyML} are restricted by strict power and compute constraints. The majority of the contemporary research in {tinyML} focuses on model compression techniques such as model pruning and quantization to fit {ML} models on low-end devices. Nevertheless, the improvements in energy consumption and inference time obtained by existing techniques are limited because aggressive compression quickly shrinks model capacity and accuracy. Another approach to improve inference time and/or reduce power while preserving its model capacity is through early-exit networks. These networks place intermediate classifiers along a baseline neural network that facilitate early exit from neural network computation if an intermediate classifier exhibits sufficient confidence in its prediction. Previous work on early-exit networks have focused on large networks, beyond what would typically be used for {tinyML} applications. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of adding early-exits to state-of-the-art tiny-{CNNs} and devise an early-exit architecture, T-{RECX}, that addresses these challenges. In addition, we develop a method to alleviate the effect of network overthinking at the final exit by leveraging the high-level representations learned by the early-exit. We evaluate T-{RECX} on three {CNNs} from the {MLPerf} tiny benchmark suite for image classification, keyword spotting and visual wake word detection tasks. Our results demonstrate that T-{RECX} improves the accuracy of baseline network and significantly reduces the average inference time of tiny-{CNNs}. T-{RECX} achieves 32.58\% average reduction in {FLOPS} in exchange for 1\% accuracy across all evaluated models. Also, our techniques increase the accuracy of baseline network in two out of three models we evaluate},

Through extensive experimentation on multiple backbones and datasets, we find that complexity-decreasing branches are more effective than constant-complexity or complexity-increasing branches, which achieve the best accuracy-cost trade-off. We investigate a cause by using knowledge consistency to probe the effect of adding branches onto a backbone. Our findings show that complexity-decreasing branching yields the least disruption to the feature abstraction hierarchy of the backbone, which explains the effectiveness of the branching patterns.},

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) is increasingly being adopted in a wide variety of application domains. Usually, a well-performing {ML} model relies on a large volume of training data and high-powered computational resources. Such a need for and the use of huge volumes of data raise serious privacy concerns because of the potential risks of leakage of highly privacy-sensitive information; further, the evolving regulatory environments that increasingly restrict access to and use of privacy-sensitive data add significant challenges to fully benefiting from the power of {ML} for data-driven applications. A trained {ML} model may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as membership, attribute, or property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence, well-designed privacy-preserving {ML} ({PPML}) solutions are critically needed for many emerging applications. Increasingly, significant research efforts from both academia and industry can be seen in {PPML} areas that aim toward integrating privacy-preserving techniques into {ML} pipeline or specific algorithms, or designing various {PPML} architectures. In particular, existing {PPML} research cross-cut {ML}, systems and applications design, as well as security and privacy areas; hence, there is a critical need to understand state-of-the-art research, related challenges and a research roadmap for future research in {PPML} area. In this paper, we systematically review and summarize existing privacy-preserving approaches and propose a Phase, Guarantee, and Utility ({PGU}) triad based model to understand and guide the evaluation of various {PPML} solutions by decomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities. We discuss the unique characteristics and challenges of {PPML} and outline possible research directions that leverage as well as benefit multiple research communities such as {ML}, distributed systems, security and privacy.},

	abstract = {Electricity theft is harmful to power grids. Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and deep {CNN} model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep {CNN} component. The deep {CNN} component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity consumption data. As a result, wide and deep {CNN} model can achieve the excellent performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic dataset show that wide and deep {CNN} model outperforms other existing methods.},

Our results speak to a tension between the desire to keep a proprietary model secret and the ability to offer model explanations. On the theoretical side, we give an algorithm that provably learns a two-layer {ReLU} network in a setting where the algorithm may query the gradient of the model with respect to chosen inputs. The number of queries is independent of the dimension and nearly optimal in its dependence on the model size. Of interest not only from a learning-theoretic perspective, this result highlights the power of gradients rather than labels as a learning primitive. Complementing our theory, we give effective heuristics for reconstructing models from gradient explanations that are orders of magnitude more query-efficient than reconstruction attacks relying on prediction interfaces.},

The user either owns the training data and computing resources to train an interpretable model herself or owns a full access to an already trained model to be interpreted post-hoc. In this chapter, we consider a less investigated scenario of diagnosing black-box neural networks, where the user can only send queries and read off outputs. Black-box access is a common deployment mode for many public and commercial models, since internal details, such as architecture, optimisation procedure, and training data, can be proprietary and aggravate their vulnerability to attacks like adversarial examples. We propose a method for exposing internals of black-box models and show that the method is surprisingly effective at inferring a diverse set of internal information. We further show how the exposed internals can be exploited to strengthen adversarial examples against the model. Our work starts an important discussion on the security implications of diagnosing deployed models with limited accessibility. The code is available at goo.gl/{MbYfsv}.},

	abstract = {Model extraction attacks are an attack in which an adversary utilizes a query access to the target model to obtain a new model whose performance is equivalent to the target model efficiently, i.e., fewer datasets and computational resources than those of the target model. Existing works have dealt with only simple deep neural networks ({DNNs}), e.g., only three layers, as targets of model extraction attacks, and hence are not aware of the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) in dealing with time-series data. In this work, we shed light on the threats of model extraction attacks on {RNNs}. We discuss whether a model with a higher accuracy can be extracted with a simple {RNN} from a long short-term memory ({LSTM}), which is a more complicated and powerful type of {RNN}. Specifically, we tackle the following problems. First, in case of a classification task, such as image recognition, extraction of an {RNN} model without final outputs from an {LSTM} model is presented by utilizing outputs halfway through the sequence. Next, in case of a regression task such as weather forecasting, a new attack by newly configuring a loss function is presented. We conduct experiments on our model extraction attacks on an {RNN} and an {LSTM} trained with publicly available academic datasets. We then show that a model with a higher accuracy can be extracted efficiently, especially through configuring a loss function and a more complex architecture different from the target model.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models trained by large volume of proprietary data and intensive computational resources are valuable assets of their owners, who merchandise these models to third-party users through prediction service {API}. However, existing literature shows that model parameters are vulnerable to extraction attacks which accumulate a large number of prediction queries and their responses to train a replica model. As countermeasures, researchers have proposed to reduce the rich {API} output, such as hiding the precise confidence level of the prediction response. Nonetheless, even with response being only one bit, an adversary can still exploit fine-tuned queries with differential property to infer the decision boundary of the underlying model. In this paper, we propose boundary differential privacy (ϵ -{BDP}) as a solution to protect against such attacks by obfuscating the prediction responses near the decision boundary. ϵ -{BDP} guarantees an adversary cannot learn the decision boundary by a predefined precision no matter how many queries are issued to the prediction {API}. We design and prove a perturbation algorithm called boundary randomized response that can achieve ϵ -{BDP}. The effectiveness and high utility of our solution against model extraction attacks are verified by extensive experiments on both linear and non-linear models. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland {AG}.},

	title = {{mmPass}: Human Body-based User Authentication Leveraging {mmWave} Signals in Open-World Scenarios},
	abstract = {User authentication is undergoing an expansion of application scenarios and innovation of technical methods nowadays. Existing user authentication approaches generally rely on biometrics, such as fingerprint, face recognition, iris recognition, etc., which may face the threat of replay attacks and the decline of user experience in extensive Internet of Things ({IoT}) environments. New approaches exploit radio frequency ({RF}) signals, e.g., {mmWave} signals, to sense human characteristics and extract individual uniqueness for user authentication, providing a contactless and nonintrusive manner that naturally defends against replay attacks. However, current {RF} signal-based approaches are confronted with constraint usage scenarios and have difficulties implementing user authentication in open-world scenarios. The open-world scenarios refer to dynamic background environments, various human poses and the presence of unauthorized users, which are reflections of practical and real usage cases of user authentication. In this paper, we present an open-world user authentication system, {mmPass}, which leverages a commercial off-the-shelf ({COTS}) {mmWave} radar to sense human bodies for identifying individuals. In {mmPass}, we first utilize a {MUSIC}-based neural network imaging model to eliminate environmental clutter and generate environment-independent human silhouette images for fine-grained feature extraction. Then, human bodies are modeled as topological structures to perform posture normalization, ensuring robustness against diverse human postures. Next, {mmPass} extracts body features through a metric learning model, and synthesizes data placeholders for a better generalization to unauthorized users. Finally, a k-{NN}-based authentication model is constructed based on the extracted body features to authenticate users’ identities. Experiments in real environments show that the proposed {mmPass} achieves an average authentication accuracy of 93.4\% and {FAR} of 2.3\% in open-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) sensors in smart buildings are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable. These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory ({LSTM}) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training convergence compared to the centralized {LSTM}. The effectiveness of our federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the {IoT} production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising the prediction performance.},

Implementing big data and the internet of things improves the monitoring and integration of different infrastructure systems in {SC} and thus makes our cities more efficient, livable, and sustainable. However, big data is more vulnerable to attacks and hacking, posing significant challenges to the {SC}'s privacy and security. Moreover, more regulations and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with centralized machine learning, federated learning ({FL}) provides a natural method to protect users' privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers have recently implemented {FL}, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security of integrated systems in {SC}. However, many technological problems and risks have been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of {FL}'s application to improve privacy and security in {SC} systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare, communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions of the implementation of {FL} in {SC} are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded that the existing {FL} systems required comprehensive testing for different types of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in {SC}.},

For rigor, we considered a full range of diabetic conditions (non-diabetic, pre-diabetic, type I diabetic, and type {II} diabetic). Recordings spanned nine different days, starting in the morning while fasting, up to a minimum of a two-hour period after eating a carbohydrate-rich breakfast. The {BGLs} from {PPG} were estimated using a suite of regression-based machine learning models, which were trained on characteristic features of {PPG} cycles pertaining to high and low {BGLs}.

To validate this approach, clinical studies that contemporaneously acquire physiological and continuous glucose variables are required. In this work, we provide insights from a clinical study undertaken to study the relationship between physiological variables obtained from a number of wearables and glucose levels. The clinical study included three screening tests to assess neuropathy and acquired data using wearable devices from 60 participants for four days.

	abstract = {Introduction
Diabetes Mellitus ({DM}) is characterized by impaired ability to metabolize glucose for use in cells for energy, resulting in high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). {DM} impacted 463 million individuals worldwide in 2019, with over four million fatalities documented. Blood glucose levels ({BGL}) are usually measured, as standard protocols, through invasive procedures. Recently, Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) based techniques have demonstrated the potential to estimate {BGL} using data collected by non-invasive Wearable Devices ({WDs}), thereby, facilitating monitoring and management of diabetics. One of the key aspects of {WDs} with machine learning ({ML}) algorithms is to find specific data signatures, called Digital biomarkers, that can be used in classification or gaging the extent of the underlying condition. The use of such biomarkers to monitor glycemic events represents a major shift in technology for self-monitoring and developing digital biomarkers using non-invasive {WDs}. To do this, it is necessary to investigate the correlations between characteristics acquired from non-invasive {WDs} and indicators of glycemic health; furthermore, much work is needed to validate accuracy.
Research Design \& Methods
The study aimed to investigate performance of {AI} models in estimating {BGL} among diabetic patients using non-invasive wearable devices data An open-source dataset was used which provided {BGL} readings, diabetic status (Diabetic or non-diabetic), heart rate, Blood oxygen level ({SPO}2), Diastolic Blood pressure, Systolic Blood Pressure, Body temperature, Sweating, and Shivering for 13 participants by age group taken from {WDs}. Our experimental design included Data Collection, Feature Engineering, {ML} model selection/development, and reporting evaluation of metrics.
Results
We were able to estimate with high accuracy ({RMSE} range: 0.099 to 0.197) the relationship between glycemic metrics and features that can be derived from non-invasive {WDs} when utilizing {AI} models.
Conclusion
We provide further evidence of the feasibility of using commercially available {WDs} for the purpose of {BGL} estimation amongst diabetics.},

However, the fiducial points were usually detected using complex mathematical algorithms. Inflection points from derivatives waveforms are not thoroughly studied, whereas they can significantly assist in peak detection. This study is performed to investigate the derivative waveforms of {PPG} and use them to detect the important peaks of {PPG}, {VPG}, and {APG}. {PPGs} with different morphologies from 43 ischemic heart disease subjects are analyzed. Inflection points of the derivative waveforms up to the fourth level are observed, and consistent information (derivative markers) is used to detect the fiducial points of {PPG}, {VPG}, and {APG} with proper sequence. Moving average filter and simple thresholding techniques are applied to detect the primary points in {VPG} and the third derivative waveform. A total of twelve out of twenty derivative markers are found reliable in detecting fiducial points of two common types of {PPG}. Systolic peaks are accurately detected with 99.64\% sensitivity and 99.38\% positive predictivity using the 43 {IHD} dataset and Complex System Laboratory ({CSL}) Pulse Oximetry Artifact Labels database.

This study aims to assess the feasibility of a cyber-physical cardiac monitoring system to classify stroke patients with altered cardiac activity and healthy adults.

We investigated our proposed {ECG}-based patient monitoring system with 45 stroke patients (average age 70.8 years old, 68\% men) admitted to the rehabilitation center of the hospital and 40 healthy elderly volunteers (average age 75.4 years old, 38\% men). We recorded {ECG} at resting state using a single-channel {ECG} patch within three months of diagnosis of ischemic stroke (clinically confirmed). In statistical results, {ECG} fiducial features, {RR}-I, {QRS}, {QT}, {ST}, and heart rate variability ({HRV}) features, {SDSD}, {LF}/{HF}, {LF}/({LF} + {HF}), and {HF}/({LF} + {HF}) are observed as significantly distinctive biomarkers for the stroke group relative to the healthy control group. The Random Trees model presented the best classification performance (overall accuracy: 95.6\%) utilizing {ECG} fiducial variables. This system may assist healthcare enterprises in prognosis and rehabilitation management during post-stroke treatment.},

Existing research on {PPG}-based biometric systems rely on fiducial methods that extract landmarks from the {PPG} signal as features. This paper investigates non-fiducial methods that operating in a holistic manner that is less sensitive to noise in landmarks. We compare {PPG}-based human verification of 42 subjects with fiducial and non-fiducial methods (specifically, discrete wavelet transform) and classification using a neural network and support vector machine.

However, the algorithms optimizing neural network parameters remain largely hand-designed and computationally inefficient. We study if we can use deep learning to directly predict these parameters by exploiting the past knowledge of training other networks. We introduce a large-scale dataset of diverse computational graphs of neural architectures - {DeepNets}-1M - and use it to explore parameter prediction on {CIFAR}-10 and {ImageNet}. By leveraging advances in graph neural networks, we propose a hypernetwork that can predict performant parameters in a single forward pass taking a fraction of a second, even on a {CPU}. The proposed model achieves surprisingly good performance on unseen and diverse networks. For example, it is able to predict all 24 million parameters of a {ResNet}-50 achieving a 60\% accuracy on {CIFAR}-10. On {ImageNet}, top-5 accuracy of some of our networks approaches 50\%. Our task along with the model and results can potentially lead to a new, more computationally efficient paradigm of training networks.

However, the challenges brought by the {NILM} datasets and the nonavailability of common experimental guidelines tend to compromise comparison, research transparency, and replicability. The limited adoption of efficient research instruments and lack of best practices guidelines contribute in huge part to this problem, where no features, encouraging standardized formats for benchmarking, and results sharing are offered. To address these issues, we first present a brief overview of recent best practices for {DL} and highlight how deep {NILM} research can benefit from these practices. Furthermore, we suggest a novel open-source toolkit leveraging these practices, i.e., Deep-{NILMTK}. The proposed toolkit offers a common testing bed for {NILM} algorithms independently of the underlying deep learning framework with a modular {NILM} pipeline that can easily be customized. Furthermore, Deep-{NILMTK} introduces the concept of experiment templating to offer predesigned experiments allowing to enhancing research efficiency. Leveraging this concept and {DL} best practices, we present a case study of creating an online {NILM} benchmark repository1 considering eight of the most popular deep {NILM} algorithms.

	abstract = {Recently, Transformer-like deep architectures have shown strong performance on tabular data problems. Unlike traditional models, e.g., {MLP}, these architectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensional embeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue that embeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom in tabular {DL}, which allows constructing more powerful {DL} models and competing with {GBDT} on some traditionally {GBDT}-friendly benchmarks. We start by describing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules: the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and the second one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that these two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to the embeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and {ReLU} activations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features is beneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, after proper embeddings, simple {MLP}-like models can perform on par with the attention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight embeddings for numerical features as an important design aspect with good potential for further improvements in tabular {DL}.},

Recent works extend {RVFL} into deep and ensemble versions. However, {RVFL} does not have effective feature extraction methods commonly used in time series classification. This results in poor performance of {RVFL} in time series classification tasks. Also, deep {RVFL} is a relatively new and evolving area of research. In this paper, we present a framework that extracts features from Residual Networks (Resnet) and trains Ensemble Deep Random Vector Functional Link ({edRVFL}). We use features extracted from every residual block to train an ensemble of {edRVFLs}. We propose the following enhancements to {edRVFL}. Firstly, we diversity the structure of {edRVFL} and the direct link features to encourage diversity. Secondly, we built an ensemble of {edRVFLs} with the top two activation functions. Thirdly, we use two-stage tuning to save computational costs. Lastly, we perform a weighted average of all decisions made by every {edRVFL}. Experiments on the 55 largest {UCR} datasets show that using features extracted from all Residual blocks improves performance. All our proposed enhancements help improve classification accuracy or computational effort. Consequently, our proposed framework outperforms all traditional and deep learning-based time series classification methods.},

	abstract = {Because state-of-the-art language models are expensive to train, most practitioners must make use of one of the few publicly available language models or language model {APIs}. This consolidation of trust increases the potency of backdoor attacks, where an adversary tampers with a machine learning model in order to make it perform some malicious behavior on inputs that contain a predefined backdoor trigger. We show that the in-context learning ability of large language models significantly complicates the question of developing backdoor attacks, as a successful backdoor must work against various prompting strategies and should not affect the model's general purpose capabilities. We design a new attack for eliciting targeted misclassification when language models are prompted to perform a particular target task and demonstrate the feasibility of this attack by backdooring multiple large language models ranging in size from 1.3 billion to 6 billion parameters.

	abstract = {Because state-of-the-art language models are expensive to train, most practitioners must make use of one of the few publicly available language models or language model {APIs}. This consolidation of trust increases the potency of backdoor attacks, where an adversary tampers with a machine learning model in order to make it perform some malicious behavior on inputs that contain a predefined backdoor trigger. We show that the in-context learning ability of large language models significantly complicates the question of developing backdoor attacks, as a successful backdoor must work against various prompting strategies and should not affect the model's general purpose capabilities. We design a new attack for eliciting targeted misclassification when language models are prompted to perform a particular target task and demonstrate the feasibility of this attack by backdooring multiple large language models ranging in size from 1.3 billion to 6 billion parameters. Finally we study defenses to mitigate the potential harms of our attack: for example, while in the white-box setting we show that fine-tuning models for as few as 500 steps suffices to remove the backdoor behavior, in the black-box setting we are unable to develop a successful defense that relies on prompt engineering alone.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1712.05526},
	abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance on many tasks, and thus have been applied to many security-critical scenarios. For example, deep learning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to access many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of deep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to perform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this work, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the attacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication system, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor. Specifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the victim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a target label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor poisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies. Different from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply under a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model and the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to inject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard to notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation to demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning samples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90\%. We are also the first work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically implementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work demonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning system, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and proposing defense strategies against them.},

To protect confidentiality of the training data,the aggregator by design has no visibility into how these updates aregenerated.  We show that this makes federated learning vulnerable to amodel-poisoning attack that is significantly more powerful than poisoningattacks that target only the training data.A single or multiple malicious participants can use modelreplacement to introduce backdoor functionality into the joint model,e.g., modify an image classifier so that it assigns an attacker-chosenlabel to images with certain features, or force a word predictor tocomplete certain sentences with an attacker-chosen word.  We evaluatemodel replacement under different assumptions for the standardfederated-learning tasks and show that it greatly outperformstraining-data poisoning.Federated learning employs secure aggregation to protect confidentialityof participants’ local models and thus cannot detect anomalies inparticipants’ contributions to the joint model.  To demonstrate thatanomaly detection would not have been effective in any case, we alsodevelop and evaluate a generic constrain-and-scale technique thatincorporates the evasion of defenses into the attacker’s loss functionduring training.},

	abstract = {Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security of federated learning systems. However, existing research primarily focuses on backdoor attacks and defenses within the generic {FL} scenario, where all clients collaborate to train a single global model. {\textbackslash}citet\{qin2023revisiting\} conduct the first study of backdoor attacks in the personalized federated learning ({pFL}) scenario, where each client constructs a personalized model based on its local data. Notably, the study demonstrates that {pFL} methods with partial model-sharing can significantly boost robustness against backdoor attacks. In this paper, we whistleblow that {pFL} methods with partial model-sharing are still vulnerable to backdoor attacks in the absence of any defense. We propose three backdoor attack methods: {BapFL}, {BapFL}+, and Gen-{BapFL}, and we empirically demonstrate that they can effectively attack the {pFL} methods. Specifically, the key principle of {BapFL} lies in maintaining clean local parameters while implanting the backdoor into the global parameters. {BapFL}+ generalizes the attack success to benign clients by introducing Gaussian noise to the local parameters. Furthermore, we assume the collaboration of malicious clients and propose Gen-{BapFL}, which leverages meta-learning techniques to further enhances attack generalization. We evaluate our proposed attack methods against two classic {pFL} methods with partial model-sharing, {FedPer} and {LG}-{FedAvg}. Extensive experiments on four {FL} benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods. Additionally, we assess the defense efficacy of various defense strategies against our proposed attacks and find that Gradient Norm-Clipping is particularly effective. It is crucial to note that {pFL} method is not always secure in the presence of backdoor attacks, and we hope to inspire further research on attack and defense in {pFL} scenarios.},

However, metered data can be processed fairly easily by employing well-established nonintrusive appliance load monitoring techniques to infer appliance usage, which reveals information about consumers’ private lives. Existing load shaping techniques for privacy primarily focus only on altering metered real power, whereas smart meters collect reactive power consumption data as well for various purposes. This study addresses consumer privacy preservation via load shaping in a demand response scheme, considering both real and reactive power. We build a multi-objective optimization framework that enables us to characterize the interplay between privacy maximization, user cost minimization, and user discomfort minimization objectives. Our results reveal that minimizing information leakage due to a single component, e.g., real power, would suffer from overlooking information leakage due to the other component, e.g., reactive power, causing sub-optimal decisions. In fact, joint shaping of real and reactive power components results in the best possible privacy preservation performance, which leads to more than a twofold increase in privacy in terms of mutual information.},

However, the attack surface also grows with more equipment in the network, making it necessary to secure appropriately. With more sensors distributed on the network, it becomes easier for an attacker to hack into one and send false information to the central to destabilize the power generation and distribution. Load-altering attacks do precisely that and have a destructive potential since the generator reaction can cause network instability. Traditional techniques, like those based on the Kalman filter, for example, may pose numerical issues due to the large size and sparsity of the system matrices, failing to provide good results or wasting computational resources. We propose an {LMI}-based approach to design a bank of residual generators for functional observers to detect such attacks. This approach has the advantage of using a reduced order arbitrary dynamic system, making it suitable for large-scale smart grids, and the use of {LMI}, allowing the easy insertion of restrictions.},

An energy management unit ({EMU}) along with a proper battery system charge/discharge schedule can mask the consumer's actual energy use and to some extent alleviate privacy concerns. This paper speculates a hypothesis testing problem focused on {SM} privacy. The proposed model consists of an energy consumer, battery storage, {EMU}, and {SM}. The {EMU}, which controls the energy consumption policy, chooses between two hypotheses. The first one considers a normal-mode consumption policy in which {EMU} utilizes the consumer's entire energy demand from the grid. In the second hypothesis, {EMU} takes some part of the energy consumption from the grid independent of the consumer's actual demand. In this situation, the battery with a limited capacity undertakes supplying the remaining load or absorbing the excessive energy. The second approach would conceal the consumer's profile from an adversary. The energy provider, which has access to a side information, could predict the hypothesis utilized by the consumer. We denote the reliability criterion as probability of error in choosing a correct hypothesis. A case study is given in the support of effectiveness of proposed methodology.},

Due to its learning capabilities from data, {DL} technology originated from artificial neural network ({ANN}), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate {DL} model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns {DL} methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on {DL} techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation {DL} modeling with research directions.

	abstract = {While Deep Learning excels in structured data as encountered in vision and natural language processing, it failed to meet its expectations on tabular data. For tabular data, Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are the best performing techniques with Gradient Boosting in the lead. Recently, we saw a surge of Deep Learning methods that were tailored to tabular data but still underperform compared to Gradient Boosting on small-sized datasets. We suggest "Hopular", a novel Deep Learning architecture for medium- and small-sized datasets, where each layer is equipped with continuous modern Hopfield networks. The modern Hopfield networks use stored data to identify feature-feature, feature-target, and sample-sample dependencies. Hopular's novelty is that every layer can directly access the original input as well as the whole training set via stored data in the Hopfield networks. Therefore, Hopular can step-wise update its current model and the resulting prediction at every layer like standard iterative learning algorithms. In experiments on small-sized tabular datasets with less than 1,000 samples, Hopular surpasses Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, {SVMs}, and in particular several Deep Learning methods. In experiments on medium-sized tabular data with about 10,000 samples, Hopular outperforms {XGBoost}, {CatBoost}, {LightGBM} and a state-of-the art Deep Learning method designed for tabular data. Thus, Hopular is a strong alternative to these methods on tabular data.},

For instance, a tabular dataset of different demographic and clinical factors where the feature interactions are not given as a prior. In this paper, we propose Group-Connected Multilayer Perceptron ({GMLP}) networks to enable deep representation learning in these domains. {GMLP} is based on the idea of learning expressive feature combinations (groups) and exploiting them to reduce the network complexity by defining local group-wise operations. During the training phase, {GMLP} learns a sparse feature grouping matrix using temperature annealing softmax with an added entropy loss term to encourage the sparsity. Furthermore, an architecture is suggested which resembles binary trees, where group-wise operations are followed by pooling operations to combine information; reducing the number of groups as the network grows in depth. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on different real-world datasets covering various application areas. Additionally, we provide visualizations on {MNIST} and synthesized data. According to the results, {GMLP} is able to successfully learn and exploit expressive feature combinations and achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on different datasets.},

	abstract = {Smart meters ({SMs}) can pose privacy threats for consumers, an issue that has received significant attention in recent years. This paper studies the impact of Side Information ({SI}) on the performance of possible attacks to real-time privacy-preserving algorithms for {SMs}. In particular, we consider a deep adversarial learning framework, in which the desired releaser, which is a Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}), is trained by fighting against an adversary network until convergence. To define the objective for training, two different approaches are considered: the Causal Adversarial Learning ({CAL}) and the Directed Information ({DI})-based learning. The main difference between these approaches relies on how the privacy term is measured during the training process. The releaser in the {CAL} method, disposing of supervision from the actual values of the private variables and feedback from the adversary performance, tries to minimize the adversary log-likelihood. On the other hand, the releaser in the {DI} approach completely relies on the feedback received from the adversary and is optimized to maximize its uncertainty. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated empirically using real-world {SMs} data, considering an attacker with access to {SI} (e.g., the day of the week) that tries to infer the occupancy status from the released {SMs} data. The results show that, although they perform similarly when the attacker does not exploit the {SI}, in general, the {CAL} method is less sensitive to the inclusion of {SI}. However, in both cases, privacy levels are significantly affected, particularly when multiple sources of {SI} are included.},

	abstract = {The modern electricity network, known as the smart grid ({SG}), aims at improving the efficiency, reliability, and security of electric power systems by using intelligent transmission, control, and distribution networks. One of the main components of the {SG} are smart meters ({SMs}), which are devices that enable data exchange between users and utility provider ({UP}) by recording fine-grained power consumption measurements of households. This fine-grained electricity consumption data is used for billing, load forecasting, energy theft detection, and several other applications for improving the grid operation. However, the {SM} data can be shared with a third-party, which can potentially infer sensitive information about users, including the behavioral patterns or even the type of appliances used in the dwelling. Such a users' privacy violation is one of the main reasons why {UPs} are not willing to share {SM} datasets with third-parties (e.g. research groups at Universities). Moreover, this privacy issue can be considered from consumers' points of view, i.e. it concerns the users that their electricity data is eavesdropped or even they might not trust {UPs}. These two views of privacy concern with regards to {SM} data led to emerging two main families of {SM} privacy-preserving models in the literature, called data manipulation and demand load shaping.
In this thesis, we deal with the aforementioned privacy matters in {SM} data sharing, where machine learning based privacy-preserving frameworks are developed to mitigate the privacy concerns. Firstly, within the data manipulation framework, we develop an information-theoretic based causal privacy-preserving model implemented using recurrent neural networks, which, unlike all the previously proposed models, incorporates the temporal correlation of the {SM} data without imposing any explicit assumptions on the generating model of the power measurement. Generating of the release data for such a model is studied using two mechanisms including (i) adding controlled random noise to data and (ii) reducing the granularity of the data (down-sampling). Secondly, we consider the demand load shaping technique where using physical resources such as rechargeable batteries, electrical vehicle, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, and even incorporating the renewable energy sources, the actual electricity consumption of the users, as seen by the grid (i.e., the grid load), are shaped. Following the recent studies, the privacy problem is formulated within reinforcement learning framework but, more formal privacy measures such as mutual information (in its general form for time series data) are included in problem formulation and (for the first time) deep reinforcement learning is used to train an agent which is able to manage privacy and electricity cost.
All the aforementioned models are implemented based on the adversarial learning technique and their performances, for the actual {SM} dataset, are assessed (compared with the previous models) by machine learning based attackers who aim to infer private attributes of the users from release data. Moreover, different scenarios are studied such as (i) the impact of data mismatch problem in the context of {SM} privacy, which occurs when the data available to the attacker is not the same as the one used for training the releaser mechanism; (ii) the use of different distortion measures based on the application; and (iii) the effect of side information, which occurs when an attacker uses additional information to improve its performance
Alternate abstract:
Le réseau électrique moderne, connu sous le nom de réseau intelligent ({SG}), vise à améliorer l'efficacité, la fiabilité et la sécurité des systèmes d'alimentation électrique en utilisant des réseaux intelligents de transmission, de contrôle et de distribution. L'un des principaux composants du {SG} sont les compteurs intelligents ({SM}), qui sont des dispositifs qui permettent l'échange de données entre les utilisateurs et le fournisseur de services publics ({UP}) en enregistrant des mesures précises de la consommation d'énergie des ménages. Ces données de consommation d'électricité à grain fin sont utilisées pour la facturation, la prévision de charge, la détection de vol d'énergie et plusieurs autres applications pour améliorer le fonctionnement du réseau. Cependant, les données {SM} peuvent être partagées avec un tiers, ce qui peut potentiellement déduire des informations sensibles sur les utilisateurs, y compris les modèles de comportement ou même le type d'appareils utilisés dans le logement. Une telle violation de la vie privée des utilisateurs est l'une des principales raisons pour lesquelles les {UP} ne sont pas disposés à partager des ensembles de données {SM} avec des tiers (par exemple, des groupes de recherche dans les universités). De plus, ce problème de confidentialité peut être considéré du point de vue des consommateurs, c'est-à-dire qu'il concerne les utilisateurs que leurs données électriques sont écoutées ou même qu'ils pourraient ne pas faire confiance aux {UP}. Ces deux points de vue sur la protection de la vie privée en ce qui concerne les données {SM} ont conduit à l'émergence de deux familles principales de modèles de préservation de la vie privée {SM} dans la littérature, appelées manipulation de données et mise en forme de la charge de la demande.
Dans cette thèse, nous traitons des questions de confidentialité susmentionnées dans le partage de données {SM}, où des cadres de préservation de la confidentialité basés sur l'apprentissage automatique sont développés pour atténuer les problèmes de confidentialité. Premièrement, dans le cadre de la manipulation des données, nous développons un modèle causal de préservation de la vie privée basé sur la théorie de l'information, mis en œuvre à l'aide de réseaux de neurones récurrents, qui, contrairement à tous les modèles proposés précédemment, intègre la corrélation temporelle des données {SM} sans imposer d'hypothèses explicites sur la modèle de génération de la mesure de puissance. La génération des données de rejet pour un tel modèle est étudiée à l'aide de deux mécanismes comprenant (i) l'ajout de bruit aléatoire contrôlé aux données et (ii) la réduction de la granularité des données (sous-échantillonnage). Deuxièmement, nous considérons la technique de mise en forme de la demande où l'utilisation de ressources physiques telles que les batteries rechargeables, les véhicules électriques, les unités de chauffage, de ventilation et de climatisation, et même en intégrant les sources d'énergie renouvelables, la consommation électrique réelle des utilisateurs, telle que vue par le grille (c'est-à-dire la charge de grille), sont façonnés. Suite aux études récentes, le problème de confidentialité est formulé dans un cadre d'apprentissage par renforcement, mais des mesures de confidentialité plus formelles telles que l'information mutuelle (sous sa forme générale pour les données de séries chronologiques) sont incluses dans la formulation du problème et (pour la première fois) l'apprentissage par renforcement en profondeur est utilisé pour former un agent capable de gérer la confidentialité et les coûts d'électricité.
Tous les modèles susmentionnés sont mis en œuvre sur la base de la technique d'apprentissage contradictoire et leurs performances, pour l'ensemble de données {SM} réel, sont évaluées (par rapport aux modèles précédents) par des attaquants basés sur l'apprentissage automatique qui visent à déduire les attributs privés des utilisateurs à partir des données de publication.},

This fine-grained data on electricity usage exposes private information about the residents of the house like the number of occupants, times of occupancy, appliance information, and much more. A solution to obscure this data is to add a battery to each home and use it strategically to manipulate the readings observed at the smart meter. Deploying such a solution at a large scale can result in sudden peaks in the energy usage. This is an alarming concern for the electric utility companies as this may cause outages, making the grid unstable. This paper is the first to expose this shortcoming and propose algorithms to mitigate the problem while maintaining the privacy of the residents. Furthermore, this paper shows that the proposed algorithms are more effective in preserving privacy than existing ones while reducing the peak load.},

By operating the battery such that it is charged/discharged during periods with low/high prices, we can reduce the electricity energy cost. On the other hand, by operating the battery such that the electricity usage pattern can be significantly changed from the original usage pattern of appliances, we can protect user's privacy. However, those two operations are not complement with each other and there exists a trade-off between reducing cost and enhancing privacy. In this paper, we study this issue. To consider both cost and privacy in a unified way, we first define cost metric and privacy metric that should be minimized. Then, we define an overall metric as a weighted sum of the two metrics to study the trade-off between them. We formulate and solve an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the overall metric. Finally, through numerical results, we study and discuss the usage of the battery for reducing cost and enhancing privacy.},

Although such a mechanism is helpful in the optimization of the whole electricity generation, distribution, and consumption cycle, it also creates opportunities for the potential adversaries in deducing the activities and habits of the subscribers. In fact, by utilizing the standard and readily available tools of nonintrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) techniques on the metered electricity data, many details of customers' personal lives can be easily discovered. Therefore, prevention of such adversarial exploitations is of utmost importance for privacy protection. One strong privacy preservation approach is the modification of the metered data through the use of on-site storage units in conjunction with renewable energy resources. In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical programming framework to model eight privacy-enhanced power-scheduling strategies inspired and elicited from the literature. We employ all the relevant techniques for the modification of the actual electricity utilization (i.e., on-site battery, renewable energy resources, and appliance load moderation). Our evaluation framework is the first in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, for a comprehensive and fair comparison of the load-shaping techniques for privacy preservation. In addition to the privacy concerns, we consider monetary cost and disutility of the users in our objective functions. Evaluation results show that privacy preservation strategies in the literature differ significantly in terms of privacy, cost, and disutility metrics.},

We adopt the mutual information ({MI}) between the user’s demand load and the masked load seen by the power grid as a reliable and general privacy measure. Unlike previous studies, we model the whole temporal correlation in the data to learn the {MI} in its general form and use a neural network to estimate the {MI}-based reward signal to guide the {PCMU} learning process. This approach is combined with a model-free {DRL} algorithm known as the deep double Q -learning ({DDQL}) method. The performance of the complete {DDQL}-{MI} algorithm is assessed empirically using an actual {SMs} data set and compared with simpler privacy measures.

	abstract = {Smart meters, as a key component of Advanced Metering Infrastructure ({AMI}), collect fine-grained electricity consumption data for demand response in smart grids. While this data improves the grid’s accuracy, it also poses significant threats to users’ privacy. In this paper, we study the privacy issue in smart metering systems from both attacker and defender perspectives. First, we propose an improved Temporal Convolutional Network ({TCN}) based Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring ({NILM}) attack method, which infers electrical appliance usage from public load curves, addressing the gradient vanishing, gradient exploding, and other problems while improving attack accuracy. Second, we develop a rechargeable battery-assisted energy management system to hide load characteristics of electrical appliances by adding physical noise, thus resisting {NILM} attacks. To address the privacy-cost trade-off optimization problem, we propose a Practical Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Rechargeable Battery assist Privacy Preserving Method ({PRoP}) that learns optimal battery charging/discharging policies. We design a novel privacy measurement method and constraints to ensure the feasibility of system deployment and prove {PRoP}’s effectiveness in resisting {NILM} attacks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our improved {TCN}-based {NILM} method achieves an attack success rate of over 80\% on various electrical appliances, improving attack performance ({MAE}, {RMSE}) by 20\% compared to existing methods while reducing model training time. Moreover, our proposed {PRoP} achieves a better trade-off between privacy protection and electricity cost than existing battery-assisted methods, reducing costs by 5\% and the attack success ratio to 36\%, while increasing the {MAE} and {RMAE} obtained by {NILM} by 3 times. Note to Practitioners—Smart grid, which can support bidirectional information transmission, has a series of advantages, such as high efficiency and high stability. However, it also brings a significant threat to users’ electricity privacy. Although encryption-based privacy protection methods have been deployed on terminal devices of smart grids to prevent privacy leaks, this method can often only defend against intrusive attacks and has little effect on non-intrusive attacks. To this end, this paper studies the privacy issues caused by non-intrusive attacks. Specifically, to better study the protection method, we first investigate the attack mechanism and design an improved {TCN}-based Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring method. Then, we propose a Practical Reinforcement learning-based rechargeable battery-assisted Privacy preserving method ({PRoP}) to defend against this attack physically. The most practical contribution of this paper is that, compared with existing battery-assisted privacy protection methods, we do not blindly pursue algorithm performance but fully consider the practical factors of deployment, such as limiting battery capacity and constraining battery charging and discharging behavior. This can guide practitioners to better apply this technology in practice.},

In these schemes, a rechargeable battery can both prevent the meter readings from leaking the customer's energy consumption and play a role of saving the cost. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing schemes can achieve differential privacy and cost saving simultaneously. In this paper, we first propose a battery-based differential privacy-preserving ({BDP}) scheme.

Second, the probability of an {RB} to charge/discharge depends on the demand, regardless of the state-of-charge ({SoC}) of an {RB}. Third, in extreme {SoC} (near-empty or almost fully charged) of an {RB}, no noise added to the demand. To overcome these, we propose a mechanism in which a novel probability density function is designed to generate near Laplace distributed random noise. We also utilize a renewable energy source with small storage in cascade with an {RB} to enhance performance. Both theoretical analysis and simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {Smart electric meters pose a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals in their own homes. Combined with non-intrusive load monitors, smart meter data can reveal precise home appliance usage information. An emerging solution to behavior leakage in smart meter measurement data is the use of battery-based load hiding. In this approach, a battery is used to store and supply power to home devices at strategic times to hide appliance loads from smart meters. A few such battery control algorithms have already been studied in the literature, but none have been evaluated from an adversarial point of view. In this paper, we first consider two well known battery privacy algorithms, Best Effort ({BE}) and Non-Intrusive Load Leveling ({NILL}), and demonstrate attacks that recover precise load change information, which can be used to recover appliance behavior information, under both algorithms. We then introduce a stepping approach to battery privacy algorithms that fundamentally differs from previous approaches by maximizing the error between the load demanded by a home and the external load seen by a smart meter. By design, precise load change recovery attacks are impossible. We also propose mutual-information based measurements to evaluate the privacy of different algorithms. We implement and evaluate four novel algorithms using the stepping approach, and show that under the mutual-information metrics they outperform {BE} and {NILL}.},

	abstract = {Tabular data are ubiquitous for the widespread applications of tables and hence have attracted the attention of researchers to extract underlying information. One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to understand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies typically adopt Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) to model the spatial information of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational information between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic relationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information from tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, {TabularNet}. The spatial encoder of {TabularNet} utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-{GRU}) to capture statistical information and local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we design a new graph construction method based on the {WordNet} tree and adopt a Graph Convolutional Network ({GCN}) based encoder that focuses on the hierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network architecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks and utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three classification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed {TabularNet} over state-of-the-art baselines.},

We propose that applying a different regularization coefficient to each weight might boost the performance of {DNNs} by allowing them to make more use of the more relevant inputs. However, this will lead to an intractable number of hyperparameters. Here, we introduce Regularization Learning Networks ({RLNs}), which overcome this challenge by introducing an efficient hyperparameter tuning scheme which minimizes a new Counterfactual Loss. Our results show that {RLNs} significantly improve {DNNs} on tabular datasets, and achieve comparable results to {GBTs}, with the best performance achieved with an ensemble that combines {GBTs} and {RLNs}. {RLNs} produce extremely sparse networks, eliminating up to 99.8\% of the network edges and 82\% of the input features, thus providing more interpretable models and reveal the importance that the network assigns to different inputs. {RLNs} could efficiently learn a single network in datasets that comprise both tabular and unstructured data, such as in the setting of medical imaging accompanied by electronic health records.

	abstract = {While Deep Learning excels in structured data as encountered in vision and natural language processing, it failed to meet its expectations on tabular data. For tabular data, Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting are the best performing techniques with Gradient Boosting in the lead. Recently, we saw a surge of Deep Learning methods that were tailored to tabular data but still underperform compared to Gradient Boosting on small-sized datasets. We suggest "Hopular", a novel Deep Learning architecture for medium- and small-sized datasets, where each layer is equipped with continuous modern Hopfield networks. The modern Hopfield networks use stored data to identify feature-feature, feature-target, and sample-sample dependencies. Hopular's novelty is that every layer can directly access the original input as well as the whole training set via stored data in the Hopfield networks. Therefore, Hopular can step-wise update its current model and the resulting prediction at every layer like standard iterative learning algorithms. In experiments on small-sized tabular datasets with less than 1,000 samples, Hopular surpasses Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, {SVMs}, and in particular several Deep Learning methods. In experiments on medium-sized tabular data with about 10,000 samples, Hopular outperforms {XGBoost}, {CatBoost}, {LightGBM} and a state-of-the art Deep Learning method designed for tabular data. Thus, Hopular is a strong alternative to these methods on tabular data.},

Our study shows that {XGBoost} outperforms these deep models across the datasets, including the datasets used in the papers that proposed the deep models.

As a result, we propose regularizing plain Multilayer Perceptron ({MLP}) networks by searching for the optimal combination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using a joint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and their subsidiary hyperparameters.

	abstract = {Property inference attacks allow an adversary to extract global properties of the training dataset from a machine learning model. Such attacks have privacy implications for data owners sharing their datasets to train machine learning models. Several existing approaches for property inference attacks against deep neural networks have been proposed [1] –[3], but they all rely on the attacker training a large number of shadow models, which induces a large computational overhead.In this paper, we consider the setting of property inference attacks in which the attacker can poison a subset of the training dataset and query the trained target model. Motivated by our theoretical analysis of model confidences under poisoning, we design an efficient property inference attack, {SNAP}, which obtains higher attack success and requires lower amounts of poisoning than the state-of-the-art poisoning-based property inference attack by Mahloujifar et al. [3]. For example, on the Census dataset, {SNAP} achieves 34\% higher success rate than [3] while being 56.5× faster. We also extend our attack to infer whether a certain property was present at all during training and estimate the exact proportion of a property of interest efficiently. We evaluate our attack on several properties of varying proportions from four datasets and demonstrate {SNAP}’s generality and effectiveness.},

We argue that attacks should instead be evaluated by computing their true-positive rate at low (e.g., {\textless}0.1\%) false-positive rates, and find most prior attacks perform poorly when evaluated in this way. To address this we develop a Likelihood Ratio Attack ({LiRA}) that carefully combines multiple ideas from the literature.

	abstract = {With the roll-out of electric vehicles ({EVs}), the automobile industry is transitioning away from conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. As a result, the {EV} charging demand is continuously growing and to meet this growing demand, various types of electric vehicle charging stations ({EVCSs}) are being deployed for commercial and residential use. This nexus of {EVs}, {EVCSs}, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the {EV} charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of {EVs} continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either {EV} and {EVCS} equipments, or power grid, or both. The presented issues and challenges intend to ignite research efforts on cybersecurity of smart {EV} charging and enhancing power grid resiliency against such demand-side cyberattacks in general.},

	abstract = {High penetration of electric vehicles ({EVs}) has resulted in an increasing need for charging infrastructure and efficient smart charging coordination of {EVs}. In addition to residential and public charging, destination charging is another important mode of {EV} charging, and it has the potential to cover residual public charging demand. Understanding of the factors and charging coordination strategies that ensure a sustainable destination charging business is therefore of utmost importance. Literature on the topic of {EV} smart charging and coordination is growing exponentially, but the terminology used to describe coordination strategies remained ambiguous. Hence, this paper systematically classifies the literature focused on the destination charging. In doing so, various charging tariffs and business models associated with destination charging are reviewed and a comprehensive discussion on their profitability and availability is provided. Recent {EV} charging coordination strategies are reviewed and categorized to clarify the commonly used terminology. Destination charging coordination strategies are then classified, and real-world charging coordination initiatives are reviewed and summarized. The analysis contained in this paper shows that further research work on charging coordination for destination charging should account for user behavior and the potential obstacles faced by the intended scale of destination charging to determine a suitable coordination strategy. It is also recognized that implicit charging coordination strategies are understudied and should be investigated because they may circumvent problems encountered by real-world {EV} charging coordination programs.},

	abstract = {As a key pillar of smart transportation in smart city applications, electric vehicles ({EVs}) are becoming increasingly popular for their contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale {EV} deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the {EV} charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict {EV} session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, {SVM}, {XGBoost} and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with {SMAPE} scores of 9.9\% and 11.6\% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.},

	abstract = {Recently, Transformer-like deep architectures have shown strong performance on tabular data problems. Unlike traditional models, e.g., {MLP}, these architectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensional embeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue that embeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom in tabular {DL}, which allows constructing more powerful {DL} models and competing with {GBDT} on some traditionally {GBDT}-friendly benchmarks. We start by describing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules: the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and the second one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that these two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to the embeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and {ReLU} activations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features is beneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, after proper embeddings, simple {MLP}-like models can perform on par with the attention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight embeddings for numerical features as an important design aspect with good potential for further improvements in tabular {DL}.},

This paper presents an approach to identify energy sources and energy storage in smart meter data, using photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles as examples. For this purpose, the Pecan Street dataset is used, which has been extended by charging processes from the {ACN} dataset. The presented approach comprises a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and a Multilayer Perceptron, which decides separately, on the basis of the smart meter data of a household, whether an electric vehicle and a photovoltaic system are present. It is shown that the combination of both classifiers achieves accuracy of 90.50\% in the case of electric vehicle detection and 96.37\% in the case of photovoltaic systems. It is also shown that the power levels lower than 0 {kW} in the case of the photovoltaic system and higher than 5 {kW} in the case of the electric vehicles have the largest influence on the output of the Multilayer Perceptron branch, which uses the power balance distribution as input.},

This algorithm can also identify {EV} in presence of other high wattage appliances. Advantage of this algorithm is that it even works with low sampling rate of per second data (1/60 Hz) and can be easily trained with the area specific {EV} charging known database thus giving high estimation accuracy. This algorithm is checked on a monthly data of a house giving accuracy of more than 90 percentage with the output information of how much {kWh} energy has been consumed by {EV} and the mean square error only 0.05 in disaggregating {EV} charging load.},

We use machine and deep learning methods to detect {EV} signatures in hourly smart meter data. Models are trained and evaluated on labelled data, before being tested on unlabelled field data. While balanced models catch about 75\% of {EVs} at false positive rates of 35\%, tuned models detect up to 90\% of {EVs} with 10\% false positives. When using models to detect {EVs} on unlabelled Norwegian smart meter data, detections are in line with {EV} fractions from the national registry as well as expected spatiotemporal patterns. However, models may be confused by baseline consumption patterns. Collection and inclusion of labelled {EVs} is therefore the next step.},

The proposed algorithm can run on low-frequency smart meter sampling data and only requires the real power measurement, which is the type of data communicated and recorded by most smart meters. Validation results on real aggregated household loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract {EVCLs} and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as {EVs}.

	abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) is an important topic in smart-grid and smart-home. Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle ({EV}) charging in the residential environment since {EVs} charging at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that {EV} charging has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, {EV} charging monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate {EV} charging signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner ({AC}), enabling accurate {EV} charging detection and energy estimation under the presence of {AC} power signals. Besides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light computational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data recorded at the low sampling rate 1/60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on real-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125 months worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of {EV} charging is 15.7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of {EV} charging is 208.5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in disaggregating {EV} charging load signals is 0.19.},

	abstract = {Detecting electrical vehicle ({EV}) charging from smart meter data ({EV} detection) is a highly relevant problem for the distribution system operators ({DSOs}), especially with the expected growth of {EVs} worldwide. There are several reasons why {DSOs} may want to detect {EV} charging. In the present day, the main motivation is to reduce the total load on the grid in high demand periods. This can be achieved by giving incentives to {EV} owners to charge their {EVs} in low demand periods. In the future, it is also anticipated that {EVs} can act as an energy reservoir, which can be a further motivation for {EV} detection. 

In this thesis, we explore two problems of {EV} detection. First, can we detect customers that charge an {EV} at home ({EV} load profiling)? Second, can we detect when an {EV} is charging ({EV} event detection)? To solve these problems, we analyze smart meter data provided by Eidsiva (a {DSO} from Norway).  

For the problem of load profiling, we propose, a feature-based  Gaussian mixture modeling of weekly load profiles. The results are promising, showing that some {EV} owners have unique power consumption patterns.  

For the problem of event detection, we propose a modified version of {UTime} for {EV} event detection. {UTime} is a fully convolutional feed-forward neural network, initially proposed for sleep stage segmentation. The modified {UTime} is compared with previously proposed convolutional architectures for the problem of {EV} detection. Results show that {UTime} for {EV} detection outperforms the previous models on a generated labeled dataset.   

In order to solve the problem of {EV} detection, a labeled data set with ground truth is crucial. Unfortunately, this is lacking in this thesis. We resolve this issue by proposing a method of generating a labeled data set by combining two data sources. Even though the method show promise and models seem to generalize for an unlabeled dataset, more verification is needed to state conclusively that our proposed method is efficient.},

	abstract = {Electric vehicles ({EVs}) often consume large amounts of energy, and uncoordinated charging of many {EVs} may lead to grid overload, adversely impacting other customers. Electricity distributors require full visibility on the {EV} distribution to better manage operation planning of their distribution grid. However, they often have incomplete knowledge of {EV} presence in their network. Identifying {EV} customers (charging at home) using smart meter data is a nontrivial task for the grid network and energy scheduling. The difficulties include recognizing charging patterns, balancing the number of {EV} and non-{EV} customers during modeling, and building an efficient classification model. In this article, we propose a periodic pattern recognition method to extract useful {EV} charging patterns. Real world smart meter datasets are unbalanced with few {EVs} and majority of energy customers are those without {EVs}. We improve Kmedoids evaluated by dynamic time warping to obtain the representative non-{EV} training samples so that balanced samples over {EV} and non-{EV} customers can be obtained. We develop an ensemble classification model ({ECM}) by taking advantages of multiple classifiers, in which the optimization consists of obtaining the optimal subset of periodic patterns and the optimal parameters in each classifier and the optimal weights for combining classifiers. The superiority of the proposed {ECM} is demonstrated in comparison to several baseline models.},

Identifying the {EV} models connected to the power grid for accurate balance in Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-for-Grid operations is crucial. This paper proposes a novel non-intrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) method based on Weighted Power Recurrence Graphs ({WPRG}) at a 16.5 {kHz} sampling rate to accomplish {EV} model identification irrespective of brand and state of charge ({SOC}). {WPRG} can consider the relationship between voltages and currents and thus increase the variance of original electrical current values by using the extracted current and voltage waveforms. The proposed method is tested in a synthetic dataset composed of simulated {EV} charging loads combined with {SOC} information and a real-world household appliance dataset. The proposed {WPRG} method is compared with two weighted-based methods in the {NILM} background. The proposed {WPRG} method shows superior performance in identifying {EV} models and other household appliances than the other two weighted-based methods, with an overall macro F1-score of 94.3\% in identifying the whole charging loads in households.},

But charging of {EVs} raises concerns for power grids, such as load unbalance and voltage fluctuations. Therefore, distributed network operators need to have full visibility on the {EVs} in the network. This requires identifying which consumer has an {EV}. Smart meter devices collect electricity consumption of consumers, which can be potentially used to identify whether own an {EV} that is charge at home. Currently, the {EV} owners are in minority and data is heavily unbalanced meaning that the number of {EV} owners is much less than those without. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection-based method that does not use a supervised learning to identify {EV} owners. The proposed model uses temporal information from smart meter time series. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art resampling-based methods in terms of F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy.

Non-intrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) is a key technology that can be employed to monitor the multi-source load data information in the power grid and support the high-proportion access of electric vehicles. However, traditional {NILM} approaches are designed to identify the operation of household appliances and cannot be applied at the substation level directly due to frequent and intricate switching events of electrical equipment at this stage. In this paper, a {NILM} algorithm that can be applied for the monitoring of the charging behavior of electric vehicles at the substation level is proposed to support the high-proportion injection of distributed energy resources. The proposed approach employs a deep learning framework and a multi-kernel convolutional neural network (multi-kernel {CNN}) framework is used. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the self-organized datasets based on Pecan Street data and results showed that the obtained f1 score is over 90\% for both the training sets and testing sets.},

But the time-shiftable nature of the charging process of these {EVs} allow them to participate in Demand Response Programs ({DRP}) which offers a whole new dimension of flexibility in a Power system. In order to identify the availability of {EV} in a household, the grid operator can employ the concerned household's consumption data that is available through the smart meter installed there. A Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) based approach similar to Machine Learning has been proposed in this paper for identifying houses with {EV}. For operational purpose, this algorithm helps in desegregation of {EV} charging from smart meter's energy consumption data along with the determination of their charging/discharging state, and {SOC} estimation. This has been done in a non-intrusive way and is aimed towards the identification of time-flexible or shiftable loads for Demand Response ({DR}) participation. Data from the smart meters of over 1000 households have been taken into account at different sampling frequencies. Several of these households have also incorporated roof top {PV} to make them self-reliant. The practicality of the proposed approach is ascertained by the simulation results that are based on real-world situations. An error analysis has been performed to observe the effectiveness of this method. The scope of participation for the identified {EVs} in {DR} programs has been discussed in the end.},

	abstract = {The propagation of the {COVID}-19 pandemic, and the associated measures taken by many countries to slow down the spread of the disease, has significantly affected all aspects of people's lives, including the global energy sector. This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the spatial patterns of electricity consumption in six socioeconomic sectors (residential (villa and flat), industrial, commercial, government, and productive farms) in the State of Qatar. The spatiotemporal patterns of electricity consumption have been assessed using various Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) and spatial statistical modeling prior and during the pandemic. The results demonstrate variations in electricity consumption within and between the six sectors. The main changes in the electricity consumption within sectors during the pandemic year is during the lockdown phase. Spatially, some sectors are affected by the pandemic, and hence the pattern and the spatial and temporal distribution of electricity consumption has changed during the pandemic year compared to pre-pandemic years. The results also show that there were variations of spatial clustering of electricity consumption among these sectors. Most of the high-high clustering patterns are located in the mid-eastern and northeastern parts of Qatar. The highest variation in electricity consumption between sectors occurred in the productive farms due to its massive development during the pre-pandemic period and were not affected by the pandemic. There is a sharp decline in electricity consumption in both the industrial and commercial sectors during the pandemic year. Other sectors witnessed an increase in electricity consumption during the summer months, which was mainly due to travel restrictions imposed by many countries around the world. This analysis is vital for policymakers to detect the changes in electricity consumption patterns in the context of emergencies such as the pandemic.},

The deployment of smart meter networks offers the possibility of applying machine learning techniques to estimate {EV} residential consumption. This work presents an efficient algorithm for the Non Intrusive Load Monitoring ({NILM}) of {EV} consumption, which is an adaptation of a method previously proposed for high-powered water heaters.

	abstract = {Electrification of transportation is gaining traction as a viable alternative to vehicles that use fossil-fuelled internal combustion engines, which are responsible for a major part of carbon dioxide emissions. This global turn towards electrification of transportation is leading to an exponential energy and power demand, especially during late-afternoon and early-evening hours, that can lead to great challenges that electricity grids need to face. Therefore, accurate estimation of Electric Vehicle ({EV}) charging loads and time of use is of utmost importance for different participants in the electricity markets. In this paper, a scalable methodology for detecting, from smart meter data, household {EV} charging events and their load consumption with robust evaluation, is proposed. This is achieved via a classifier based on Random Decision Forests ({RF}) with load reconstruction via novel post-processing and a regression approach based on sequence-to-subsequence Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) with conditional Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}). Emphasis is placed on the generalisability of the approaches over similar houses and cross-domain transferability to different geographical regions and different {EV} charging profiles, as this is a requirement of any real-case scenario. Lastly, the effectiveness of different performance and generalisation loss metrics is discussed. Both the {RF} classifier with load reconstruction and the {DNN}, based on the sequence-to-subsequence model, can accurately estimate the energy consumption of {EV} charging events in unseen houses at scale solely from household aggregate smart meter measurements at 1–15 min resolutions.},

To develop a data-driven utility {EV} grid integration strategy, {EV} customer charging behaviors need to be well understood.

In this paper, we present a lightweight efficient {EV} disaggregation methodology, with several advantages using real power measurements from advanced meter infrastructure ({AMI}) meters and demonstrated the algorithm and utility applications at scale (approximately 62,000 customers), and showed how the results can support utilities’ strategic need to develop a reliable, affordable, and safe {EV} integration strategy.},

	abstract = {Residential electric vehicle ({REV}) is an advanced technology with a rapid growth rate in transportation and electric grids. One key challenge in the operation of {REVs} is the necessity of the accurate, reliable, and practical forecasting method to provide accurate information of the charging profile in the look-ahead hours. In power system, in order to optimize the production and consumption as much as possible, in addition to accurately predicting the amount of electricity consumption, it is necessary for the stability of the grid to take into account the imminent probabilities. This paper presents the main principle of the probability density function forecasting approach in residential electric vehicle ({REV}) charging profile. To this end, an end-to-end deep learning structure is designed and integrated with kernel density estimation ({KDE}). The designed network is composed of four major blocks, i.e., convolutional layers to extract full spatial features, gated recurrent unit ({GRU}) to fully understand the temporal features as a time-efficient version of the gated deep network, an autoregressive ({AR}) to model the long patterns including battery type, {REV} type, and number of {REVs} and kernel density estimator block. Furthermore, to improve the learning ability of the designed network, an attention mechanism is integrated into the design network. The numerical results on the actual {REVs} (about 348 {REVs}) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed network through several cases and comparison with several well-known deep and shallow-based methods.},

Due to the multistate and high-frequency characteristics of integrated residential appliances from the residential perspective, it is difficult to achieve accurate extraction of the charging load pattern. To deal with that, this article presents a novel charging load extraction method based on residential smart meter data to noninvasively extract {REV} charging load pattern. The proposed algorithm harnesses the low-frequency characteristics of the charging load pattern and applies a two-stage decomposition technique to extract the characteristics of the charging load. The two-stage decomposition technique mainly includes: the trend component of the charging load being decomposed by seasonal and trend decomposition using loess method, and the low-frequency approximate component being decomposed by discrete wavelet technology. Furthermore, based on the extracted characteristics, event monitoring, and dynamic time warping is applied to estimate the closest charging interval and amplitude. The key features of the proposed algorithm include 1) significant improvement in extraction accuracy; 2) strong noise immunity; 3) online implementation of extraction. Experiments based on ground truth data validate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing ones.},

Recent studies have evidenced that {EV} users do not plug in their vehicle every day (here called non-systematic plug-in behavior), which can alter the impacts of {EV} charging and the flexibility that {EV} fleets can provide to the system. This work set out to evaluate the effect of considering non-systematic plug-in behavior in {EV} grid integration studies. To do so, an open-access agent-based {EV} simulation model that includes a probabilistic plug-in decision module was developed and calibrated to match the charging behavior observed in the Electric Nation project, a large-scale smart charging trial. Analysis shows that users tend to plug-in their {EV} between 2 and 3 times per week, with a lower plug-in frequency for large-battery {EVs} and large heterogeneity in user charging preferences. Results computed using our model show that non-systematic plug-in behavior effects reduce the impact of {EV} charging, especially for price-responsive charging, as fewer {EVs} charge simultaneously. On the other hand, non-systematic plug-in can reduce available flexibility, particularly when considering current trends towards larger battery sizes. Counter-intuitively, large-battery fleets can have reduced flexibility compared to small-battery fleets, both in power and stored energy, due to lower plug-in frequency and higher energy requirements per charging session. Improving plug-in ratios of {EV} users appears as key enabler for flexibility. In comparison, augmenting charging power can increase the flexibility provided by {EV} fleets but at the expense of larger impacts on distribution grids.},

	abstract = {Transport sector electrification represents an increase in the number of electric vehicles ({EV}), producing significant variations in the distribution network dynamics. As a result, bidirectional power flow, overload and load unbalances are caused at the low voltage level due to unexpected increased load peaks. Non-intrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) methods have been developed as a strategy for energy management systems, applied to the customer side producing energy savings. This research presents a {NILM} methodology based on a low complexity conventional supervised machine learning pipeline. Our approach uses Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) and Random Forest ({RF}) to detect the presence of a charging electric vehicle on the electricity network. By processing low sampling rate active power data, this approach provides a simple but feasible method that can be applied to smart meters. This provides useful data analysis for distribution network operators ({DNO}) to effectively deal with variability caused by these low carbon loads in the distribution grid. Achieving an overall efficacy of 92.68\%, the proposed method can be compared with other state of the art methods developed under higher complexity techniques.},

An identification algorithm which can accurately extract individual {EV} charging profiles out of widely available smart meter measurements has attracted great interests. This paper proposes a non-intrusive identification framework for {EV} charging profile extraction, which is driven by deep generative models ({DGM}). First, the proposed {DGM} is designed as a representation layer embedded into the Markov process and used to model the joint probability distribution of available time-series data. A novel contribution is to approximate posterior distributions by neural networks whose parameters are obtained by variational inference and supervised learning. Second, the {EV} charging status is inferred from the {DGM} via dynamic programming. Lastly, the desired {EV} charging profile can be reconstructed by the rated power of {EV} models and inferred status. Compared with the benchmark Hidden Markov Models, the proposed framework can better handle noise in data with less computational complexity and better overall accuracy performances with smaller recall. The proposed framework is validated by numerical experiments on the Pecan Street dataset.},

Due to the limited direct monitoring data, it is of great significance to extract electric vehicle charging load with the aggregated smart meter data from the household perspective. In order to deal with that, this paper presents a novel framework to realize the non-intrusive extraction and forecasting of residential electric vehicle charging load. Firstly, the Factorial Hidden Markov Model ({FHMM}) algorithm is used to extract the charging load of the residential electric vehicles. The appropriate number of hidden states is selected by the iterative k-means method to establish the {FHMM} model of simultaneous operation of multiple devices. Then, the Long-Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) deep learning algorithm is used to forecast the electric vehicle charging load of residential electric vehicle in a short time period. Real smart meter data is used to test the proposed method and the result shows its feasibility for significant performance in the extraction, as well as the forecasting.},

In electric vehicle ({EV}) mobility, these applications are used by drivers to locate charging stations in public spaces, pay for charging transactions, and engage with other users. This activity generates a rich source of data about charging infrastructure and behavior. However, an increasing share of this data is stored as unstructured text—inhibiting our ability to interpret behavior in real-time. In this article, we implement recent transformer-based deep learning algorithms, {BERT} and {XLnet}, that have been tailored to automatically classify short user reviews about {EV} charging experiences. We achieve classification results with a mean accuracy of over 91\% and a mean F1 score of over 0.81 allowing for more precise detection of topic categories, even in the presence of highly imbalanced data. Using these classification algorithms as a pre-processing step, we analyze a U.S. national dataset with econometric methods to discover the dominant topics of discourse in charging infrastructure. After adjusting for station characteristics and other factors, we find that the functionality of a charging station is the dominant topic among {EV} drivers and is more likely to be discussed at points-of-interest with negative user experiences.},

However, large-scale deployment of {EV} charging stations poses multiple challenges to the power grid and public infrastructure. To overcome the issue of prolonged charging time, the simple solution of deploying more charging stations to increase charging capacity does not work due to the strain on power grids and physical space limitations. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing smart scheduling algorithms to manage the demand for public charging using modeling and optimization. More recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven approaches in modeling {EV} charging. Consequently, researchers are looking to identify consumer charging behavior pattern that can provide insights and predictive analytics capability. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review for the use of supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning as well as Deep Neural Networks for charging behavior analysis and prediction.

In the first step, unlike other similar works, online {PEV} recognition is performed by means of an artificial neural network as a supervised classification method. The required feature space for classification is provided using the power spectral density estimation and the statistical analysis of individual {PEVs} charging current. The second step deals with the statistical modeling of the charging habits to facilitate the scheduling by predicting the charging demand using the current measurements on the grid side. In this respect, each {PEV} charging habit is modeled based on the correlation among the plug-in time, departure time, required energy, and weekdays using kernel density estimation. The performance of the suggested method is validated using real data collected from a charging station. The final results confirm the applicability of the proposed methodology with a satisfactory precision.

Due to its high-power consumption, the utility industry has strong motivation to provide this extra demand on off peak hours. It is anticipated that the potential stresses on power delivery systems can be mitigated through asset management, system design practices, controlled charging of {PEVs}, or some combination of the three. Due to high variability in customers’ {EV} choices, car types, charging patterns, charging preferences, and participation in utility-centric {TOU} (time of usage) charging options, utility will not be able to manage this risk in an ex post fashion. In many cases, it is likely the utility will not be notified or aware of an electric vehicle ({EV}) addition. Such inefficiency calls for big data-centric approach that can not only detect households with {PEVs}, but can also provide some customized {PEV} charging incentives to managing imbalance in the grid system. Present paper developed a data-driven approach detecting households charging {PEVs}. The analysis performed here is based on high frequency advanced metering infrastructure ({AMI}) data obtained from a large-scale utility company in Midwest. The data-driven models developed here achieved an accuracy of 80\% or more in successfully detecting households with {PEVs}.},

Extracting electric vehicle charging load patterns is a key factor that allows smart grid operators to make intelligent and informed decisions about conserving energy and promoting the stability of the electrical grid. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm to extract electric vehicle charging load patterns nonintrusively from the smart meter data. Furthermore, a method to define flexibility for the collective electric vehicle charging demand by analyzing the time-variable patterns of the aggregated electric vehicle charging behaviors is presented. Validation results on real residential loads have shown that the proposed approach is a promising solution to extract electric vehicle charging loads and that the approach can effectively mitigate the interference of other appliances that have similar load behaviors as electric vehicles. Furthermore, a case study on real residential data to analyze electric vehicle charging trends and quantify the flexibility achievable from the aggregated electric vehicle load in different time periods is presented.},

	abstract = {The Smart Grid ({SG}) is an emerging modernized electrical power system with advanced monitoring and control mechanism, and improved fault-tolerance. Electric Vehicles ({EVs}), with their energy storage capability, are gaining popularity as an integral part of the energy management system in the {SG}. To balance the load-demand condition of the grid, {EVs} are required to schedule a charging event before participation. However, the information transmitted by an {EV} in charging events can reveal personal information of its owner. The privacy-preserving methods for {EVs} in existing literature are based on anonymous authentication mechanism, where, missing a charging event by an {EV} is considered as malicious and the {EV} is penalized. However, missing a charging event may happen due to many valid reasons and flexibility of scheduling can encourage consumer participation. In this paper, an authentication method is proposed to achieve anonymity and flexibility in charging events for {EVs}. Additionally, a charging station network setup that divides a large regional area into smaller zones to improve privacy, is proposed. Results based on a {MATLAB} simulation are presented to demonstrate the Degree of Anonymity ({DoA}) achieved in different stages of the proposed method, the optimal number of missed charging events, and sub-division of zones.},

Home charging of {EV} will bring overloading of transformer thus producing adverse effect on smart grid. In such conditions monitoring of {EV} charging plays a vital role in {EV} charge Scheduling and to monitor the power loading pattern of different houses under a transformer while {EV} charging by monitoring the smart meter. In this paper by Non-Intrusive load monitoring ({NILM}) an algorithm is developed that will disaggregate {EV} charging load and {kWh} consumed by {EV} from the aggregated power signal (real power in watts) of many appliances. This algorithm can also identify {EV} in presence of other high wattage appliances. Advantage of this algorithm is that it even works with low sampling rate of per second data (1/60 Hz) and can be easily trained with the area specific {EV} charging known database thus giving high estimation accuracy. This algorithm is checked on a monthly data of a house giving accuracy of more than 90 percentage with the output information of how much {kWh} energy has been consumed by {EV} and the mean square error only 0.05 in disaggregating {EV} charging load.},

Unlike previous {PPG}-based authentication techniques that generate user signatures only during the initial interaction, our session-based approach tackles inter session {PPG} drifting by generating a user signature at the start of each session. Our model is composed by two modules: Firstly, heavy deep autoencoders ({AE}) are utilized for feature extraction and, secondly, a lightweight Local Outlier Factor ({LOF}) is employed for user authentication.Additionally, we introduce a continuous updating system for the {LOF} model, which automatically recovers from security breaches and can enhance authentication accuracy by more than 9\%. Our experiments show that in a single-session scenario, our model achieves authentication accuracies of 93.5\% and 91.8\% on the {CapnoBase} and {BIMDC} benchmarking datasets, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline model by 3.2\% and 1.6\% on both datasets, respectively. In multiple-session scenarios, our scheme attains an authentication accuracy of 95\% when tested on the {BioSec}2 dataset, effectively mitigating inter-session {PPG} drifting and achieving an advantage of more than 8.5\% in authentication accuracy over the state-of-the-art method. In terms of execution speed, our solution is seven times faster at runtime compared to competing state-of-the-art solutions.},

	abstract = {Since canonical machine learning algorithms assume that the dataset has equal number of samples in each class, binary classification became a very challenging task to discriminate the minority class samples efficiently in imbalanced datasets. For this reason, researchers have been paid attention and have proposed many methods to deal with this problem, which can be broadly categorized into data level and algorithm level. Besides, multi-class imbalanced learning is much harder than binary one and is still an open problem. Boosting algorithms are a class of ensemble learning methods in machine learning that improves the performance of separate base learners by combining them into a composite whole. This paper’s aim is to review the most significant published boosting techniques on multi-class imbalanced datasets. A thorough empirical comparison is conducted to analyze the performance of binary and multi-class boosting algorithms on various multi-class imbalanced datasets. In addition, based on the obtained results for performance evaluation metrics and a recently proposed criteria for comparing metrics, the selected metrics are compared to determine a suitable performance metric for multi-class imbalanced datasets. The experimental studies show that the {CatBoost} and {LogitBoost} algorithms are superior to other boosting algorithms on multi-class imbalanced conventional and big datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the {MMCC} is a better evaluation metric than the {MAUC} and G-mean in multi-class imbalanced data domains.},

	abstract = {Class imbalance ({CI}) in classification problems arises when the number of observations belonging to one class is lower than the other. Ensemble learning combines multiple models to obtain a robust model and has been prominently used with data augmentation methods to address class imbalance problems. In the last decade, a number of strategies have been added to enhance ensemble learning and data augmentation methods, along with new methods such as generative adversarial networks ({GANs}). A combination of these has been applied in many studies, but the true rank of different combinations would require a computational review. In this paper, we present a computational review to evaluate data augmentation and ensemble learning methods used to address prominent benchmark {CI} problems. We present a general framework that evaluates 10 data augmentation and 10 ensemble learning methods for {CI} problems. Our objective is to identify the most effective combination for improving classification performance on imbalanced datasets. The results indicate that combinations of data augmentation methods with ensemble learning can significantly improve classification performance on imbalanced datasets. Our study is vital for the development of novel models for handling imbalanced datasets.},

The most common modelling approaches rely on car movements provided in household travel surveys ({HTS}), despite their large data bias towards internal combustion engine vehicles. The scientific community has long wondered whether this characteristic of {HTSs} would undermine the conclusions drawn for {EV} mobility. This work applies state-of-the-art modelling techniques to the Swiss national {HTS} to conclusively prove, by means of validation, the reliability of these commonly used approaches. The cars tracked in the survey are converted to {EVs}, either pure battery or plug-in hybrids, and their performance is simulated over 4 consecutive days randomly sampled from the survey. {EVs} are allowed to charge at both residential and public locations at an adjustable charging power. Charging events are determined by a finely calibrated plugging-in decision scheme that depends on the battery’s state of charge. The resulting charging loads corroborate the validation, as these successfully compare with measurements obtained from several {EV} field tests. In addition, the study includes a sensitivity analysis that highlights the importance of accurately modelling various input parameters, especially {EVs}’ battery sizes and charging power. This work provides evidence that conventional {HTSs} are an appropriate instrument for generating {EV} insights, yet it adds guidelines to avoid modelling pitfalls and to maximise the simulation accuracy.},

Even though the penetration of electric vehicles ({EV}) in the passenger vehicle fleet is increasing, the energy mix is not yet dominated by renewables. This leads to the utilization of fossil-based power generation for {EV} charging, especially during peak hours. In this work, we introduce a residential smart {EV} charging framework that prioritizes solar photovoltaic ({PV}) power self-consumption to accelerate the transition to a carbon neutral passenger vehicle fleet. Our approach employs N-Step Deep Reinforcement Learning to charge the {EV} with clean energy from a {PV}, without neglecting other major factors that influence end users’ behavior, such as electricity cost or {EV} charging tendencies. Historical smart-meter data from the Pecan Street dataset on total consumption, {EV} demand and solar generation has been utilized as input features to train the Deep {RL} method so that it decides on a real-time basis whether to charge or not the {EV}, without the need for foresight of future observations. Experimental results on six residential houses validate that, compared to uncontrolled {EV} charging, the proposed method can increase the average self-consumption of solar energy for {EV} charging by 19.66\%, as well as reduce network stress by 7\% and electricity bill by 10.3\%.},

Second, to review electric vehicle charging load models with their strengths and weaknesses. Third, to provide suggestions on matching the models reviewed to six datasets found in this research that have not previously been explored in the literature. The open data search covered more than 860 repositories and yielded around 60 datasets that are relevant for modelling electric vehicle charging load. These datasets include information on charging point locations, historical and real-time charging sessions, traffic counts, travel surveys and registered vehicles.

In this paper, we present a stochastic simulation study to assess the impacts of {PEV} charging on the power generation under various penetration and charging schedule scenarios in the State of Qatar. Penetration ratios are obtained from new {PEV} sales statistics from four different countries, namely Norway, Netherlands, France, and China. Actual 5-min electricity load profiles are used and peak-consumption day is chosen to evaluate the worst-case scenario. The results show that current power generation in Qatar has enough spare capacity to fuel up vehicles, however, uncontrolled {PEV} charging may require additional peak-power generators if the government goal of 10\% {PEVs} penetration rate is reached. Finally, recommendations for solar-{PEV} charging is provided by analyzing the actual load and global horizontal irradiance measurements.},

	abstract = {To avoid the operational consequence of thermal rating exceedance and the financial consequence of excessive reinforcement, the impact of domestic charging of electric vehicles ({EVs}) on power distribution networks must be accurately assessed prior to accepting vehicle electrification at the community-scale. Although driven by routine, charging behaviour patterns are also influenced by geography, meteorological conditions and season, hence will have a localised element to them that could reduce the diversity of charging load profiles. To model this uncertainty, this article develops a probabilistic methodology to quantify {EV} home charging demands based on vehicle mobility data and underlying trip characteristics. Models articulate the departure time distribution using a mixture of von Mises distributions, and incorporate non-negative conditional distributions of trip durations, distances and parking durations, which in turn generalise localised charging behaviours. The resulting load profiles are used to drive a community electric network model based on a distribution feeder in Qatar, a country with high per km energy consumption, to quantify impact scenarios of high temperature and driving habit in terms of voltage and thermal stability. Results indicate that overnight domestic charging is sufficient to support daily trips and local networks are capable of hosting high {EV} penetration despite peaks.},

	abstract = {Even though Qatar’s per capita electricity consumption is one of the highest in the world, little is currently known about behind-the-meter power consumption. The residential sector is the largest consumer of electricity, accounting for approximately 59\% of the overall consumption of electricity. As energy subsidies lead to budget deficits and overconsumption of carbon resources, there is a pressing need to examine the residential load profile to better understand consumption patterns and uncover potential solutions for more efficient usage. Residential load profiles are typically influenced by seasonal and socio-economic factors. Furthermore, household load profiles can be used to examine the viability of rooftop photovoltaic ({PV}) systems. In this study, a total of 10 houses in Qatar were chosen, and their power demand was monitored for over a year using smart energy monitors. This empirical research was conducted to achieve the following goals: (1) creation of the first high-resolution residential load profiles in Qatar and in the Gulf region; (2) analyses of the acquired load profiles and the determining factors that affect energy consumption; and (3) calculation of self-consumption values, analysis of the viability of household rooftop {PV} systems, and discussing potential use-cases for energy storage systems. Investigation of this topic is particularly important for Qatar as the country is adopting a sizable portion of {PV} systems (5\% by 2021) and promotes sustainable energy options as a part of a national development strategy. Results show that there are significant differences between per-household and per-capita consumption due to factors such as electricity subsidies, household income and size, and air-conditioner type. Moreover, due to high electricity consumption, distributed energy storage units for bill management applications have limited applicability with current pricing tariffs. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Qatar and in the Gulf region where a growing amount of interest is given to measure and improve building energy performance.},

	abstract = {Qatar is known to be one of the most energy-intensive countries in the world, yet very little is known about its electricity consumption patterns. In this paper, we unfold the electricity sector in Qatar by presenting high-resolution electricity load profiles, analyzing the unique consumption patterns, and with case studies, showing how load profiles can be used in applications such as demand-side management, renewable energy integration, and mathematical modeling. Moreover, using load profiles, we propose a methodology to estimate the cooling demand which represents the largest portion of the domestic demand. The data used in this study is collected from the official website of the Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority ({GCCIA}), validated by the available public datasets, and span a 12 month period from February 2016 to January 2017. The present paper contains the first high-resolution dataset in the {GCC} region and the results will shed light into future research studies.},

	abstract = {In Qatar, nearly 60\% of the electricity is consumed in the domestic sector, yet very little is known about behind the meter electricity consumption. In this paper, we present and analyze electricity load measurements taken at ten houses in Qatar. We installed Smappee energy monitors at each house and recorded the measurements at 5-min intervals. This study includes measurements from July to November 2017. Results indicate that air-conditioning dominates residential consumption. Furthermore, the size of the house and the air conditioning type are the main determinants of the electricity consumption for summer months, while in winter months the difference in consumption per capita diminishes significantly. To the best of author's knowledge, this is the first study that presents behind the meter electricity consumption data in Qatar and in the {GCC} region. Such results will be used in future research activities such as designing {PV} rooftop-energy storage systems and demand response programs.},
